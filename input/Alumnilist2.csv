"How life could have emerged from the chemistry present on early Earth remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Much progress has been made on the syntheses of compounds proposed to be important for life's origins under early Earth conditions since the original Miller-Urey experiment in 1953. Nevertheless, it is increasingly apparent that investigating these systems in separation is not only insufficient but also prevents the emergence of more complex behaviours. This thesis aims to investigate chemical reaction networks comprising small molecules proposed to be present on early Earth taking inspiration from nonlinear dynamics and systems chemistry approaches. Chapter 3 bridges well-established prebiotic nucleotide precursor synthesis with the autocatalytic formose reaction. Experimental results revealed that cyanamide defers the exponential phase of the formose reaction and commandeers formose sugar products for nucleotide precursor synthesis. These observations demonstrate how metabolism-like behaviours could have emerged from prebiotic reaction networks. Chapter 4 investigates the formation of pH gradients across phospholipid membranes using the formaldehyde-sulfite reaction. The concentration of (bi)sulfite in the running buffer significantly affected the lumenal pH of the vesicles after purification by size-exclusion chromatography, which was attributed to the leakage of (bi)sulfite as SO2 . In addition, the lumenal pH of vesicles purified with and without (bi)sulfite in the running buffer also behaved differently upon the addition of formaldehyde. These results demonstrate how different environments can affect protocells encapsulating similar chemistries and lead to different responses to the same stimulus. Chapter 5 studies H2-driven carbon fixation catalysed by iron sulfides (FeS) in simulated hot spring environments using an anaerobic flow reactor connected to a GC-FID. Results showed that FeS-catalysed carbon fixation was primarily driven by high temperatures (80–120 °C) and could be further enhanced via irradiation with UV–visible light. Among the synthesised FeS samples, pure and Mn-doped FeS showed the highest catalytic activities. Mechanistic studies using in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations revealed that the reduction occurred via a reverse water–gas shift, which is comparable to the mechanism of the enzymatic acetyl-CoA pathway. The observations herein indicate that FeS-catalysed carbon fixation likely occurred in early Earth hot springs, the mechanism of which may provide insights into the emergence of early metabolic pathways.
Development of activated sorbents for removal and reductive defluorination of PFAS",2024,"Sun, Jun"
"In nature, soft functional materials like human tissue are formed through the supramolecular assembly of biological polymers across the nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale. Harnessing the design rules of these naturally occurring hierarchical structures to synthesise our own functional biomimetic materials is an important research goal spanning multiple fields including supramolecular chemistry, materials science, tissue engineering and medicine. Rational design has allowed us to craft self- assembling peptides with structural similarities to natural materials, but recreating their inherently dynamic functional properties remains challenging. In this thesis, I introduce a short self-assembling peptide based on the tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) motif, which shows multiscale hierarchical ordering leading to emergent dynamic properties in the resulting hydrogels. Initially conceived to serve as a simple monomeric model to study β-tertiary structure and folding, I demonstrate that with minor residue substitutions, the Trpzip motif can be repurposed as the minimal structural unit from which nanofibrous, tissue-mimetic hydrogels can be assembled. Using molecular dynamics simulations to navigate the vast sequence space, I identified, synthesized, and validated a Trpzip variant which formed a self-assembling hydrogel under physiological conditions. I then examined the nanoscale and microscale properties of these Trpzip hydrogels through a variety of spectroscopy, microscopy, and neutron scattering techniques. Next, I characterised the mechanics of pure Trpzip hydrogels, finding that they show tunable viscoelasticity, can shear-thin and self-heal like other supramolecular hydrogels yet display unique yield-stress properties, and demonstrate stress-relaxation behavior reminiscent of native tissue. With a variety of other supramolecular and covalent chemistry approaches, I explore ways to further modulate the mechanical and biochemical profile of Trpzip hydrogels. Finally, a range of cellular and organotypic models were integrated into Trpzip hydrogels to demonstrate their potential as synthetic 3D tissue scaffolds. I show pure Trpzip hydrogels support a variety of mammalian cell types including fibroblasts, myoblasts, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and its rheological properties make the hydrogel amenable to clinical and biofabrication applications such as syringe- based cell delivery and 3D bioprinting. Using various human intestinal organoid models, I show Trpzip hydrogels can support complex yet critical biological processes such as self-organization, morphogenesis, and polarization. Altogether, the research presented in this thesis expands the supramolecular peptide design space, introduces a synthetic biomaterial with potential for use in tissue engineering and medicine, and contributes to our growing understanding of the materials chemistry principles central to recapitulating native tissue matrices.
Design and synthesis of novel biologically active flavones and isoflavones",2024,"Fu, Xiaoming"
"The primary aim of this project was to develop different methodologies for the synthesis of novel 4-arylisoflavans and isoflavenes or analogues that structurally resemble isoflavonoids. In addition, the incorporation of fused-ring systems into the isoflavonoid scaffold to synthesize analogues of a bioactive natural product was also explored. The synthesized analogues were tested against cancer cells with results showing that a number of these compounds displayed promising anti-cancer effects. The construction of 4-arylisoflavan scaffold started with the preparation of phenyl propynyl ethers either by Williamson ether synthesis or Mitsunobu reaction, depending on the electronic nature of the propynyl aromatic systems which were introduced at the terminal alkyne via Sonogashira coupling. The intramolecular cyclization was carried out through an electrophilic borylative reaction followed by immediate esterification to furnish the benzopyran core with a boronic ester at 3-position. Subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction allowed for the attachment of various aromatic systems, giving access to 4-arylisoflavenes which were readily converted to cis 4-arylisoflavans by catalytic hydrogenation. The established methodology paved the way for flexible structural modification and possessed the advantage of preparing a large library of isoflavans in a short period of time. Attempts were also made to improve the bioactivities of 4-arylisoflavans by replacing the benzopyran core with 1,4-benzoxazine, which required the development of an alternative strategy. The synthesis of the benzoxazine ring was achieved by reduction of the nitro group and subsequent reductive amination of readily available precursors 2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrophenoxy)-1-arylethan-1-ones. An additional reduction step using NaCNBH3 was performed to increase amine conversion. The secondary amine present in the benzoxazine iv scaffold was substituted with either aromatic systems via Buchwald-Hartwig crosscoupling or different benzyl moieties. Subsequent functionalization such as amination and demethylation further expanded the substrate scope of 3,4-disubstituted benzoxazines. The synthesis of aza-analogues of 4-arylisoflavenes, or 3,4-disubstituted quinolines and their reduced analogues started with the construction of N-phenyl-2-propynylamines where the amine was protected with a tosyl group. Different aryl substituents were then introduced at the terminal alkyne through Sonogashira coupling reaction. Electrophilic iodocyclization furnished the quinoline scaffold for subsequent coupling at 3-position to afford the tosylated 3,4-diaryl-1,2-dihydroquinolines which were readily converted to desired 3,4-diarylquinolines by convenient deprotection. Furthermore, the catalytic reduction of the tosylated intermediates to generate the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines was also explored.
Development of Daidzein-based Peptide Mimics as Novel Antimicrobial Agents",2024,"Hong, Zijian"
"Small molecule compounds have been explored for diseases related to the brain. This thesis focused on exploring small molecule candidates that could act as therapeutic options against ischemic stroke and glioblastoma. Although the nature and pathophysiology of these two diseases are different, the therapeutic treatments that have been explored here focused on the fact that whether the candidates could pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to exhibit their action. Chapter 2 and chapter 3 focused on drug candidates against ischemic stroke, and chapter 4 focused on the anticancer treatment option against glioblastoma. Ischemic stroke occurs due to the disruption of blood flow within the blood vessels in the brain. The reason for this disrupted blood flow could be clot formation or a plaque or even air bubbles within the brain's blood vessels. A physiological response to induced hypoxia could protect the neuronal damage after a stroke. The hypoxia response is regulated by an enzyme called prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) which hydroxylates the hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) transcription factors. So, the plan was to synthesize the candidate analogues that could potentially inhibit the active site of PHD2 enzyme so that, stabilized HIF-α promotes a hypoxic response. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of six candidate inhibitors, and prediction of their ability to bind PHD2 through in silico docking studies. Chapter 3 describes the investigation of the neuroprotective activity of selected candidates. This work led to two breakthrough findings: (i) neuroprotective activity is observed even when the drugs are administered 2 h post-injury; and (ii) the candidates' physicochemical properties can be made more suitable for BBB permeability without destroying the cell-based neuroprotective activity. Chapter 4 focused on novel anticancer candidate molecules that could bind to the tumor DNA irreversibly to inhibit tumor resistance. Two proposed scaffolds were explored. The 1st scaffold was an aziridine-based DNA crosslinking agent. The 2nd scaffold was an aziridine-containing agent designed to inhibit the enzyme topoisomerase II. The synthesis route was challenging due to the instability of the aziridine side chain in different reaction conditions. This project has not been explored completely due to time constraints. Overall, this thesis has explored small molecule synthesis followed by investigating promising biological properties to emphasize their potential. Diseases like stroke or glioblastoma can be dreadful and that is why small molecule that can be used to treat these brain disorders would be vitally important. The mechanism of action of these two treatments is different as in one of them (ischemic stroke), the candidate compound should inhibit the target enzyme (PHD2) whereas in the other case (glioblastoma) the aziridine candidate would act on the tumor DNA. In both cases, the target compound should cross the BBB. The next research work of these potential analogues should target whether their appropriate candidate to cross the BBB or not. Furthermore, new analogues should be made and their neuroprotection capability needs to be explored.
Novel antimicrobial strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections",2023,"Browne, Kate"
"Healthcare-associated infections are the most common adverse event affecting hospital patients. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, there is an increasing number of untreatable infections. Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of novel antibacterial strategies to both prevent, and treat, healthcare-associated infections. This thesis explores three key approaches to treat and prevent the transmission of healthcare-associated infections. First of all, a library of novel antibacterial compounds were assessed in vitro for their clinical potential. The compounds with the greatest clinical potential were then tested in various biomaterial applications (biocompatibility in an animal model, and their activity when covalently attached to biomaterial surfaces). Finally, this thesis explores antibacterial strategies to prevent the transmission of bacteria from clinical surfaces. The lead antimicrobial candidates, melimine and RK758, are peptidomimetics that address the drawbacks of conventional antibiotic therapy. They showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (including clinical antibiotic-resistant isolates), anti-biofilm activity and thermal stability. When peptidomimetics were used in combination with traditional antibiotics, bacteria were unable to develop resistance towards antibiotics or peptidomimetics. This combination antibiotic-peptidomimetic therapy also showed synergistic activity, which further increases the potential for these compounds to treat multidrug-resistant infections. When assessed in two clinical applications, peptidomimetics showed promise for their continued clinical development. Both melimine and RK758 were biocompatible in animal models. When peptidomimetics were loaded into bone allograft, there was no inhibition of bone healing in a critical-sized distal femur defect model. Moreover, when these peptidomimetics were covalently attached using a new polydopamine coating method to biomaterial surfaces, they retained their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and prevented biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This thesis also explores the transmission of pathogens from clinical surfaces, and how ultraviolet-C disinfection could be used in healthcare-facilities to reduce the bacterial bioburden on various clinical surfaces. Overall, adjunct ultraviolet disinfection significantly reduced the bioburden on surfaces in operating theatres and clinical rooms. Overall, these three strategies work together to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Preventing the transmission of pathogens from the environment to patients, is known to reduce healthcare-associated infection rates. Furthermore, the development and application of novel-acting antibiotics offers a solution to the antibiotic-resistance crisis and addresses the urgent need for antimicrobials with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. If commercialised, the strategies proposed in this thesis have the potential to increase activity of ineffective antibiotics and prolong their use in the clinic.
Novel antibacterial strategies for bioceramic- and polymer-based orthopaedic biomaterials.",2023,"Chakraborty, Sudip"
"Protein-ligand interactions play a crucial role in various biological processes of living organisms. Thus, characterising protein-ligand interactions is important for understanding the mechanism of ligands in signalling pathways as well as developing novel drugs. This thesis describes the application of native mass spectrometry (MS) to studying protein-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry and environmental chemistry, and the use of additives to stabilise the proteinligand complexes in the gas phase for improved native MS measurements. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of peptides targeting heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). Hsp27's main function is to bind misfolded proteins and prevent them from aggregating. However, the aberrant activity of Hsp27 has been implicated in numerous diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. An analogue of peptides derived from the N-terminal domain of Hps27 was identified to bind to Hsp27 using native MS for the first time. To date, these are also the smallest peptides reported to bind to Hsp27 and affect citrate synthase aggregation. This native MS approach may be useful for identifying other promising compounds targeting Hsp27. The aim of the research detailed in Chapter 3 is to identify per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that can bind to the major whey protein β-lactoglobulin (BLG) in bovine milk. PFASs are a topic of global health concern owing to their persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation and toxic effects in humans and animals. Native MS was used to investigate the binding affinities and the binding site of PFASs to BLG. Six out of 19 of the PFASs investigated can bind strongly to two isoforms of BLG at the same binding site as endogenous ligands. These results demonstrate a potential route for the bioaccumulation of PFASs in cow milk and an approach to remove PFASs from BLG. Chapter 4 aims to investigate the effect of the Hofmeister series of anions on protein-ligand interactions in native MS. For β-lactoglobulin and stearic acid system, the addition of citrate and tartrate to the ESI solutions resulted in significant stabilisation of the complex such that the binding affinities increased by a respective 42% and 40% compared to using ammonium acetate alone. For lysozyme binding to tri-N-acetylchitotriose, bromide and thiocyanate dramatically decreased the dissociation constants especially at lower charge states. Therefore, some specific anions can be added to the solution to stabilise protein-ligand complexes in the gas phase and improve their dissociation constants.
Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel Pseudomonas Quinolone Quorum Sensing (PQS) Inhibitors as Antimicrobial Agents",2022,"Sabir, Shekh"
"Quorum sensing (QS) in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) plays a critical role in biofilm development and production of numerous virulence factors which has ultimately led to the development of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Therefore, the development of small molecules which can inhibit bacterial QS without affecting bacterial growth could be an effective strategy to overcome anti-microbial resistance. 
The primary objective of the work described in this thesis was the development of novel small molecules that can inhibit Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) based quorum sensing signaling in P. aeruginosa. To inhibit PQS biosynthesis, by using the ligand-based drug-design approach, novel triazole-nucleoside containing anthraniloyl adenosine monophosphate mimics were designed and synthesized to target enzyme anthraniloyl-CoA synthetase (PqsA), which is involved in the first step in quinolone biosynthesis, A total of 14 anthraniloyl-adenosine monophosphate derivatives were synthesized using a multi-step synthetic route and screened for quorum sensing inhibition activity. To develop dihydropyrrol-2-ones (DHPs) as PqsR antagonists by modifications at the exocyclic double bond, a method for mono-bromination at the vinylic position was developed using a 1,3-dibromo-5,5- dimethylhydantoin reagent. In a subsequent reaction, brominated DHPs were converted to thioether-linked analogues using mild reaction conditions. The screening results showed that the 2-mercaptopyridyl analogue 7g exhibits PqsR antagonist activity with IC50 32 µM. The molecular docking study reveals that 7g interacts with the ligand-binding domain of PqsR. In addition, it was found that brominated DHPs can be converted into corresponding selenourea and thiourea derivatives under mild reaction conditions. Therefore, a series of novel selenourea and thiourea containing analogues were synthesized and tested for QSI and anti-bacterial activities. Interestingly, selenium DHPs showed comparatively more activity than the corresponding sulfur derivatives. The most active compound 3e showed 53% QSI activity at 31 µM in Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 15.6 µM against Gram-positive S. aureus. In search of the quinolone-based competitive antagonists of PqsR, disulfide bond containing novel quinazolinone derivatives were designed by using a ligand-based drug-design approach. By varying the aliphatic side chain and substitution around the heterocyclic ring, a small library of disulfide derivatives was synthesized. The most active derivative 8q showed promising activity against pqs QS system with IC50 of 4.5 µM in the P. aeruginosa pqsA:gfp reporter based assay. In addition, 8q showed complete suppression of pyocyanin production as well as moderate activity against P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in PAO1 and PA14 strains. Furthermore, 8q potentiates antibacterial activities of known antibiotics ciprofloxacin and tobramycin when used in combination. Finally, the molecular docking study revealed that 8q exhibits identical orientation and binding interaction as a natural ligand in the ligand-binding domain of PqsR.
SYNTHETIC PROCEDURE OF NOVEL ANTICANCER COMPOUNDS BASED ON 1,4-NAPHTHOQUINONES",2022,"Jones, John"
"Nanocatalytic tumor therapies involve established strategies to increase the concentration of endogenous oxygen species (ROS) H2O2 to cytotoxic levels. These strategies are based on increasing the ROS levels through stimuli from drugs, the action of ROS-producing agents, and nanoparticulate catalysis. However, these techniques frequently are indiscriminatory, being cytotoxic to diseased cells and normal cells alike, leading to significant unwanted side-effects. The present work reports a new paradigm strategy based upon the catalytic action of a cell-discriminative, ROS-mediating, autophagy-suppressive nanoparticle, which is CePO4·H2O (rhabdophane). CePO4·H2O nanoparticles were synthesised using CeNO3·6H2O precipitated in an aqueous solution of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) at room temperature. The nanoparticles were well crystallised, equiaxed (~10-35 nm), of positive surface charge, and of general valence ratio 〖""Ce"" 〗_""0.8"" ^""3+"" 〖""Ce"" 〗_""0.2"" ^""4+"" 〖""PO"" 〗_""4.1"" . Materials characterisation involved particuological (hydrodynamic particle size, surface area, zeta potential), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction, laser Raman microspectroscopy), chemical (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), structural (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and microstructural (transmission electron microscopy) analyses. Biological characterisation involved examination of the effects on HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MRC-5 normal fibroblasts in terms of cellular interactions (cell viability by MTT assay), cellular uptake and trafficking (confocal laser scanning microscopy, biological transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry), ROS generation (confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry), apoptosis (annexin V-FITC assay), gene expression (q-RT-PRC), and protein expression (western blot analyses). The key observations and conclusions from the biological evaluation are as follows: Discriminative Cytotoxicity: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first to exhibit discriminative cytotoxicity: At 24 h, fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell viability is ~10% but MRC-5 normal cell viability is ~45%. Discriminative Uptake: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first, without the use of a targeting ligand, to be internalized readily by cancer cells but scarcely by normal cells. Self-Targeting: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are trafficked toward the mitochondrial environment and possibly the converse trafficking. Mitochondrial Starvation: The preceding proximity between CePO4·H2O nanoparticles and cancer cell leads to increased phosphate concentration in the cellular environment, the concentration gradient of which effectively starves the mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial stress and dysfunction. Discriminative ROS Generation: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first to demonstrate elevated cellular ROS in cancer cells by multiple mechanisms while normal cells exhibit only a low level of such elevation. Autophagy Suppression: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles suppress autophagy, thereby increasing cellular stress and suppressing cancer cell survival, thus offering a complement to mitochondrial starvation. Redox Switching: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first nonmetallic nanoparticles to balance redox switching through simple electronic charge compensation rather than more complex ionic charge compensation. Biocompatibility: As hydrated phosphates, CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are more biocompatible than metals or oxides, suggesting greater feasibility of renal clearance. These advantages derive from the key role of the redox and defect equilibria arising from the oxidation reaction Ce3+ → Ce4+ + e′, which is induced by the acidic pH environment of the cancer call versus the stability of the Ce3+ valence in the basic pH environment of the normal cell. The former both elevates the ROS level and disrupts the electron transfer chain. Ultimately, the suppression of the proliferation of cancer cells derives from the cross-talk involving cellular ROS elevation, autophagy suppression, and their mitochondrial control.
Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Phenylglyoxamide- and Benzothiazole-Based Small Molecular Peptidomimetics as Antibacterial Agents",2022,"Yu, Tsz Tin"
"The rapid emergence and development of antibacterial resistance is a major global threat to public health. There is an urgent need for the development of antibacterial agents with novel therapeutic strategy to tackle the increasing incidence of antibacterial resistance. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their synthetic mimics have been under the spotlight of the development of a novel class of antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance. This research project focused on the utilisation of phenylglyoxamide and benzothiazole scaffolds in the development of antimicrobial peptidomimetics. The synthesis of phenylglyoxamide-based peptidomimetics was achieved via the ring-opening reactions of N-sulfonylisatins with primary amines followed by salt formation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the peptidomimetics against different bacterial strains were determined to assess their antibacterial activity. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed the inverse relationship between the alkylsulfonyl chain length and the bulkiness of the phenyl ring system for high antibacterial activity. The most active peptidomimetics exhibited high antibacterial activity with the lowest MIC to be 4, 16 and 63 μM against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. These peptidomimetics also showed significant biofilm disruption (up to 50%) and inhibition (up to 70%) against S. aureus at 2–4× MIC. In addition, terphenylglyoxamide-based peptidomimetics synthesised by the ring-opening reaction of N-acylisatins with amines and amino acid esters were evaluated for their quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) activity against P. aeruginosa MH602. The most potent peptidimimetic possessed high QSI activity of 82%, 65% and 53% at 250, 125 and 62.5 μM, respectively, with no bacterial growth inhibition. On the other hand, benzothiazole-based peptidomimetics were synthesised via the Jacobson method of cyclisation of phenylthioamides, followed by the installation of cationic groups. 2-Naphthyl and guanidinium hydrochloride as the hydrophobic and cationic groups, respectively, were important for high antibacterial activity of the peptidomimetics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most potent peptidomimetics against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa possessed MIC values of 2, 16 and 32 μM, respectively. These active peptidomimetics inhibited 39% of S. aureus biofilm formation and disrupted 42% of preformed S. aureus biofilms at sub-MIC.
Development of novel ubiquitin specific protease 5 (USP5) inhibitors to treat neuroblastoma",2022,"Gadde, Satyanarayana"
"This thesis describes the synthetic development and biological investigation of a new class of cyclic peptide inhibitors that target heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) interactions with companion proteins known as co-chaperones. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the foundation for all biological activities. The interaction networks formed by multi-protein complexes propels regulatory and structural intracellular processes. The ubiquitous involvement of PPI's in virtually all biological systems represents great scope for therapeutic modulation of PPIs in disease, making them a highly promising target in drug discovery. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a nodal protein that forms hundreds of interactions with client proteins and co-chaperones and is central to many crucial biochemical networks in the cell. Previous strategies in inhibiting Hsp90's crucial oncogenic functions through N-terminal inhibition led to marked failures, with promising compounds exhibiting significant toxicity and developing resistance in clinical trials. Progress in computational sciences has led However, targeting the C-terminus MEEVD region provides a new opportunity for inhibiting Hsp90 without inducing the negative effects observed with N-terminal inhibitors. Firstly, the trends in pharmaceutical development and causes of attrition in drug development are discussed, followed by an evaluation of the complex and diverse nature of PPI therapeutic targets. In particular, the dynamic and modular nature of Hsp90 interactions with co-chaperones are investigated to determine the feasibility of possible inhibitory strategies. Secondly, the novel class of Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors termed LB is explored in a structure activity relationship study to identify key residues important for biological activity. In chapter 3, the lead molecule LB76 is carried forward to evaluate its specificity to the Hsp90 protein target, confirm binding site on said protein and investigated for its ability to halt key functions of Hsp90. Finally, in chapter 4, the lead molecules LB76 and controls are taken forward to endeavour cell entry strategies using polymeric nanoparticles.
Disrupting Chemical Communication in Bacteria: Design and Synthesis of new Quorum Sensing Inhibitors",2020,"Almohaywi, Basmah"
"Bacterial infections, particularly hospital-acquired infections caused by resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have become a global threat with a high mortality rate. Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa employ N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as chemical signals to regulate the expression of pathogenic phenotypes through a mechanism called quorum sensing (QS). Recently, strategies targeting QS have received great attention due to their ability to disarm rather than kill pathogenic bacteria, which lowers the evolutionary burden on bacteria to develop resistance. Halogenated lactones and fimbrolides from marine algae exhibit antimicrobial activities against several bacterial species by reducing the expression of pathogenic phenotypes. Related dihydropyrrol-2-one (DHP) analogues, which bear a nitrogen atom in place of the oxygen in the heterocyclic ring, are more hydrolytically stable under physiological conditions compared to the corresponding lactones. This thesis focused on the design and synthesis of novel derivatives of dihydropyrrolone as QS inhibitors based on three different scaffolds. The quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) activity of the synthesised compounds was determined against a P. aeruginosa MH602 reporter strain. Computational docking studies were performed using a crystal structure of the LasR receptor protein of P. aeruginosa. The first study focused on the synthesis of N-alkyl- and N-aryl 3,4-dichloro- and 3,4-dibromopyrrole-2-one derivatives through the reductive amination of mucochloric and mucobromic acid with aliphatic and aromatic amines. The phenolic compounds exhibited the best activity with up to 80% QSI at 250 μM, The second study focused on the design and synthesis of novel 5-methylene-4-aryl-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-ones. A simple and efficient procedure for the synthesis of N-aryl 5-methylene-4-aryl-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one derivatives has been developed through copper-mediated C-N bond formation. The synthetic protocol allows for versatile and robust C-N arylation with a range of readily available boronic acids under mild conditions. Further modifications of the dihydropyrrolone (DHP) scaffold focusing on five features around the DHP motif were investigated and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of 53 DHP compounds were comprehensively analysed and studied. In a third study, a range of novel acetylene derivatives of dihydropyrrolone were synthesised via Sonogashira coupling reactions between brominated dihydropyrrolones and alkynes. Some of the acetylene compounds showed promising QSI activity against P. aeruginosa.
Glyoxylamide- and Anthranilamide-based Self-assembled Hydrogels for Antibacterial Therapy",2020,"Aldilla, Vina"
"Bacterial infection is a major problem world-wide that not only threatens public health but also causes heavy economic burdens. This problem is made worse by the rise in antimicrobial resistance in consequence of over-prescription and improper use of antimicrobial agents. Thus, development of alternative antimicrobials and their formulation has become an urgent need. Hydrogels are biomaterials that can be endowed with antimicrobial function by incorporating another active agent or through their self-assembled component. However, current hydrogels have some limitations such as lack of chemical diversity, toxicity, and undesired burst-release of bioactive agents. This work explores the synthesis of glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides as self-assembled gels and their antibacterial potency. The glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides were synthesised via ring-opening reactions of N-acylisatins and isatoic anhydride, respectively, with L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine in solution phase. These short peptides successfully formed hydrogels at relatively low concentrations (0.08 - 0.20% w/v) and their properties were characterised using various spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. Hydrogels made from glyoxylamide-based short peptide exhibited high loading capacity (40% w/w), a sustained release profile, and capability to retain the antibacterial efficacy of ciprofloxacin (an antibacterial) against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. On the other hand, hydrogels developed from anthranilamide-based short peptides exhibited inherent antibacterial activity by showing significant bacterial reductions against S. aureus. Importantly, the majority of glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based hydrogels demonstrated low toxicity against mammalian cells. The current study also investigated the potential of anthranilamide-based short peptides for nitric oxide (NO) delivery. The hydrogel formed from anthranilamide-based hydrogel bearing NO donor, as the antibacterial agent, displayed an effective photo-generation of NO radicals (NO•) upon illumination by light. Furthermore, the release of NO was detected using the Griess assay and demonstrated light-dependent NO release which was also evidenced in the in vitro antibacterial assay against E. coli. Glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides, therefore, showed the potential to be used as an antibacterial material to treat infections.
Development of bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme inhibitors and total synthesis of an archaea signalling molecule",2020,"Wenholz, Daniel"
"Photolysis drives the formation of all radicals in the atmosphere. Carbonyls are photoactive and ubiquitous in the atmosphere as the oxidative degradation products of all volatile organic compounds. The structural diversity of carbonyls poses a challenge to atmospheric models, as experimental photolysis parameters are available for only a small subset of atmospheric species. In this work, photolysis structure-activity relationships (SARs) are derived for the carbonyl moiety as a whole, using quantum chemical calculations that are extensively validated to be accurate to within 10 kJ/mol of experimental data. All photolysis pathways on the electronic states accessible in the 300–330 nm tropospheric wavelength range (S1, T1, and S0) are calculated for 20 representative carbonyl species across 7 structurally distinct classes. An additional 18 larger carbonyl species are used to study the Norrish Type II (NTII) reaction. The B2GP-PLYP double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) method is used for the S0 and T1 states. Inexpensive composite protocols are formulated for predicting S1 energies, using systematic trends in equation of motion coupled cluster vertical excitation energies, and affordable (time-dependent) DFT methods for geometries and vibrational frequencies. Norrish Type I α-bond photolysis thresholds are rationalised as an interplay of hyperconjugation and α-bond delocalisation effects. The inaccessibility of S1 photolysis thresholds, and the alternate bond cleavage in α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, is used to clarify ambiguous experimental data. The S1/T1 preference of the NTII γ-hydrogen abstraction reaction is rationalised by hyperconjugation and allylic resonance stabilisation of the incipient 1,4-biradical intermediate. Multiconfigurational calculations verify an S1/S0 conical intersection along the NTII reaction coordinate. A concerted S0 NTII channel explains recent pentan-2-one data, and is predicted to be accessible in all saturated carbonyls. Similarly, SARs are derived for eight energetically relevant ground state photolysis channels that are mostly absent from atmospheric models. The comprehensive SARs derived in this work are shown to be applicable to a broader set of carbonyl species beyond the datasets used. In case studies of 2-methylbutanal and pinonaldehyde photolysis, where previous analyses have been inconsistent, the photolysis SARs were able to provide consistent mechanisms and explain observed photoproducts.

"Pincer ligands attract great current interest because they bestow exceptional stability on their metal complexes. Modification of the pincer scaffold can be used to tune the electron density at the metal ion and, therefore, the physical and chemical properties. This thesis reports studies of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)pyrrolide (dpp–) NNN-pincer ligands and their transition and rare-earth metal complexes. Homoleptic complexes were prepared and screened for useful physical (e.g., magnetic or photophysical) or chemical (e.g., redox or reactive) properties. Predictable control of the properties through the substitution of the pyrrolide ring was a particular goal, and was achieved. The critical review of the literature on the chemistry of dpp– ligands and related pyridine-pyrrolide pincers, Chapter 1, concluded that a range of dpp– derivatives with flexible coordination modes was accessible, but with underdeveloped coordination chemistry. Chapter 2 provides a theoretical quantification (B3LYP-GD3BJ/6-31G** calculations) of the internal stain (ΔEL(strain)) that builds when a dpp– or related pyridine-pyrrolide pincer ligand binds a metal ion. A relationship was discovered correlating ΔEL(strain) and the change in interatomic separation of the two terminal donor atoms when bound (ρL(coord)) and metal-free (ρL(relax)). The relationship was employed to explain, a posteriori, the occurrence of spin crossover activity in Fe(II)-pincer complexes. A series of five structurally similar cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(dppR1,R2)2], bearing different pyrrolide 3,4-substituents are discussed in Chapter 3. The oxidation and spin states of the cobalt ion were switched by appropriate external stimuli, with the CoIII/CoII couple predictably sensitive to the Swain-Lupton electronic parameters for the pyrrolide substituents. Chapter 4 describes the first lanthanide(III) complexes of dpp– ligands. Ligand-sensitised, lanthanide-centred emission was observed for [Eu(dppCO2Me,Me)3] (red emission) and [Yb(dppCO2Me,Me)3] (near-infrared emission). Chapter 5 reports enhanced reactivity for [Ru(dpp)2] complexes compared to the ubiquitous [Ru(tpy)2]2+. Hemilability of the dpp– ligand results from its large ρL(relax), and this was exploited for catalytic transformations of small molecules bound at the ruthenium(II) centre. Four small preliminary studies are included in Chapter 6, each providing an entry point into more detailed future investigations. Chapter 7 provides a summary of the results, highlights advances made and suggests how these could be used into the future.
Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel nitrogen heterocycles as therapeutic agents.",2019,"Dobrowolski, Jeremy"
"New technologies are revolutionizing disease diagnostics. Sensitive determination of disease related biomarkers to which single molecule detection is the ultimate goal, will help doctors to make precise decision and effective treatment on time which is of significant importance to patience's wellbeing. Recently nanopore-based sensors emerge rapidly as one promising technology in biophysical and bio-analytical studies due to single entity sensitivity and label-free manner. However, so far the main research has been focusing on works at single-pore sensors. The other concern is that it is challenging to quantify target analytes in ultra-low concentrations as it takes time for rare copies of molecules to find and pass through a nanopore that is governed by Brownian motion and electrophoresis. In addition to this, it is still an unsolved issue to achieve single molecule resolution when applying devices of multipores to biosensing studies based on electric signals. This dissertation presents the development of implementation of biosensing devices based on solid-state chips with nanopore arrays for single-molecule detection of proteins. Chapter 1 provides a perspective review over the recent developments of ultrasensitive bioanalytical sensors and the challenges this class of biosensor faces when moving to single molecule quantitative sensors. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the field of nanopore and nanopore-based biosensing applications. Recent advances in bio-analytical applications are reviewed followed with a summary about the scientific questions to be addressed in this dissertation. Chapter 3 documents the information for chemicals, materials, instrumentations, operational conditions and procedures that have been employed in the following chapters. In relating to the above mentioned questions, Chapter 4 describes the work about deploying a novel sensing paradigm called ""Nanopore Blockade Sensors"" for single-molecule detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) demonstrated here as a model protein analyte. Rare copies of PSA molecules have been detected in buffered solutions and blood samples at chips of 3 × 3 nanopore array, showing comparable performance to that from a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. It is demonstrated that the developed sensors are capable of directly detecting PSA from human whole blood, indicating the potential to sense PSA in complex matrix without pre-treatment process. Also studies with nanopore based sensors demand the capability to differentiate chemical functionalities at nanopore inside and outside areas and potentially conduct systematic investigation about contributions from these two surface areas. Therefore, Chapter 5 introduces a material-specific modification strategy and is demonstrated first at microsized planar surfaces. After successful demonstration at planar interfaces, Chapter 6 presents the work about fabrication and sensing performance of devices with gold metallized nanopore arrays. This is the first ever investigation of fabrication of metallic nanopore array where the metal coating is spatially deposited onto nanopore interior walls only and this work sheds light on research into sophisticated fabrication and further optical studies with the fabricated solid-state metallic nanopores. Chapter 7 summarizes the work of this dissertation and provides a viewing about the future prospects with solid-state devices of (metallic) nanopore arrays as sensors in bio-analytical and biomedical applications.
Synthesis of Novel Fused-Ring Flavonoid Systems and Their Anticancer Activity",2018,"Nuraini, Vidia Afina"
"The primary aim of this project is to develop novel anti-tumor agents based on the scaffolds of two natural flavonoids phenoxodiol and (+)-catechin, and evaluate their biological properties and mechanism of action in cancer cells. The phenoxodiol scaffold was structurally modified through molecular hybridization and addition of fused-ring systems. Phenoxodiol was combined with 1-amino-2-propanol and thiosemicarbazone moieties to generate novel phenoxodiol-hybrids. The 1-amino-2-propanol and thiosemicarbazone moieties were linked with phenoxodiol through nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide intermediate, and through Schiff base condensation with an aldehyde or ketone intermediate. Synthesis of fused hybrid systems was carried out via an inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction between electron-rich dienophiles and ortho-quinone methide intermediate of phenoxodiol. In order to overcome the poor bioavailability of flavonoids, which limits their clinical use, different drug delivery vehicles for phenoxodiol and (+)-catechin were explored. Carbohydrates, β-cyclodextrin and dextran, were selected for their aqueous solubility and biocompatibility. Phenoxodiol was encapsulated into β-cyclodextrin via a modified co-evaporation method, and was alternatively conjugated onto dextran using an enzymatic method. (+)-Catechin was conjugated onto β-cyclodextrin via a cycloaddition strategy. In vitro anti-proliferative activities of the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated against various cancer cell types. In general, most of the compounds exhibited strong anti-proliferative activities across all the tested cancer cell lines. Importantly, many of them also showed an overall increase in specificity as compared to the parent molecule. As angiogenesis plays an important role in cancer progression, the anti-angiogenic mechanism for dextran-catechin conjugate was investigated and demonstrated that it inhibited angiogenesis by disrupting copper metabolism within the endothelial cells. The conjugate was shown to generate reactive oxygen species that lead to reduction of ATOX-1 protein, which protects the cells from oxidative stress. ATOX-1 is also responsible for the transport of copper within the cell and to the VEGF promoter, which is required for angiogenesis. This study shows that structural modification and the employment of carbohydrate-based drug delivery vehicles can be an effective strategy to enhance the overall anti-tumor activity of flavonoids.

"The primary objective of this thesis is to synthesise novel thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators and investigate their anti-proliferative activity against neoplastic cells. Traditionally, iron chelators were developed for the treatment of iron overload diseases. However, the increased requirement for iron in rapidly proliferating cells, compared with normal cells, create an opportunity to use iron as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Previous development of thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators created new iron chelators with potent and selective anti-tumour activity towards a wide variety of human and murine tumour xenografts such as 2-benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazone (BpT) and 2-(3'-nitrobenzoyl)pyridine thiosemicarbazone (NBpT). In order to understand the structure-activity relationship of the thiosemicarbazone scaffold, novel BpT analogues were designed. First attempt was made by incorporating methyl substitution on the pyridine ring and mono- or di- methoxy substitutions at the phenyl ring. In addition, incorporation of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the phenyl substituents of the N4-position of the BpT scaffold was done. Subsequently, dimerisation of BpT by forming dithiosemicarbazones using 2,6-dibenzoylpyridine were also investigated. Most of the novel thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators showed significantly higher anti-proliferative activity than the commercially available, gold-standard chelator desferrioxamine. Structure-activity relationship study revealed that the chelators with a single methyl substitutent on the pyridine ring had the highest anti-proliferative activity. Incorporation of mono- or di- substitution at the phenyl ring resulted in lower anti-proliferation activity, while methoxy substitution at the phenyl ring enhanced iron chelation efficacy. The study also indicated that benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazones with electron-donating substituents resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity than electron-withdrawing groups. The increased molecular weight of the chelators influences the lipophilicity of the ligands resulting in low or moderate potency of the chelators towards neoplastic cells. The new information provided by this study could assist in the design and synthesis of future development of thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators with higher anti-proliferative activity and iron efficacy.

"The primary aim of the project was to investigate various methodologies for the synthesis of aza-analogues of isoflavones, or 4-quinolones, and their reduced analogues with an oxygenated pattern that is present in naturally occurring flavonoids. A series of 3-aryl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-ones was synthesized by the reaction of 3,5-dimethoxyaniline with α-aryl-β-ketoesters, giving enamino esters which were then converted to the corresponding 4-quinolones by thermal cyclization. The reduced 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-one analogues were synthesized by the reaction of 3,5-dimethoxyaniline with α-aryl-β-ketoesters in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, followed by amino group protection and ester hydrolysis. The resulting acids were then cyclized and deprotected to give the desired 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones. The previously unreported 4-arylazaisoflavans were synthesized via two approaches. In the first approach, a Grignard reaction was performed on the carbonyl group of the 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones, and the resulting alcohol was dehydrated and hydrogenated to give the fully reduced ring system, with a cis arrangement of substituents. In the other approach, the carbonyl group of 2,3-dihydroquinoline was reduced to an alcohol, which was then reacted with various nucleophiles. This approach gave the corresponding 4-aryl and 4-heteroarylazaisoflavan ring systems with a trans arrangement of substituents. The pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one ring system was synthesized from 4-quinolones. The reaction of α-bromo-acetophenones with 4-quinolones gave the corresponding quinolinoketones which on acid catalyzed cyclization gave the desired pyrroloquinolin-6-one. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with lithium aluminium hydride yielded the corresponding dihydroquinolin-6-ones. Selective demethylation of the C5-methoxy group in the synthesized 4-quinolones, 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones and pyrroloquinolones was performed using cerium chloride and sodium iodide. Similar reactions with borontribromide gave dihydroxy analogues of 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-one but was found to only selectively demethylate 4-arylazaisoflavans at C5. Dimethoxyquinolones also underwent Mannich reaction at C8 with primary amines and amino acid esters to give quinazolones.
Novel antimicrobial biomaterials based on cationic peptides",2012,"Chen, Renxun"
"It is envisaged that in our technologically advanced society, every person would have a biomedical device or implant in their life time. However, bacterial infections on these life-saving devices have emerged as a major problem. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop biomaterial surfaces which resist bacterial adhesion and colonisation. Melimine is a synthetic cationic peptide with excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Further, this peptide is not cytotoxic at active concentrations and is readily heat-sterilizable. In this study, we explored the ability of Melimine to prevent bacterial adhesion when covalently tethered on glass and FEP using two attachment strategies: non-specific attachment via azide linkers and site-directed attachment via maleimide linker. The melimine coated surfaces showed excellent activity against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with up to 40-fold reduction in bacterial adhesion compared to the untreated samples in vitro. The influence of tethering parameters were also examined, peptide concentration, orientation and linker reactivity were found to be important factors to consider for optimal activity. In vivo efficacy of melimine was also demonstrated with a 1-log reduction in viable bacteria compared with the controls in a subcutaneous mouse model. Solution-based antibacterial assays were also carried out for palmitoylated melimine and melimine-coated beads. Melimine has demonstrated excellent potential for further development as an effective antimicrobial coating in the prevention of device-related infections.
