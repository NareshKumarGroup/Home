"How life could have emerged from the chemistry present on early Earth remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Much progress has been made on the syntheses of compounds proposed to be important for life's origins under early Earth conditions since the original Miller-Urey experiment in 1953. Nevertheless, it is increasingly apparent that investigating these systems in separation is not only insufficient but also prevents the emergence of more complex behaviours. This thesis aims to investigate chemical reaction networks comprising small molecules proposed to be present on early Earth taking inspiration from nonlinear dynamics and systems chemistry approaches. Chapter 3 bridges well-established prebiotic nucleotide precursor synthesis with the autocatalytic formose reaction. Experimental results revealed that cyanamide defers the exponential phase of the formose reaction and commandeers formose sugar products for nucleotide precursor synthesis. These observations demonstrate how metabolism-like behaviours could have emerged from prebiotic reaction networks. Chapter 4 investigates the formation of pH gradients across phospholipid membranes using the formaldehyde-sulfite reaction. The concentration of (bi)sulfite in the running buffer significantly affected the lumenal pH of the vesicles after purification by size-exclusion chromatography, which was attributed to the leakage of (bi)sulfite as SO2 . In addition, the lumenal pH of vesicles purified with and without (bi)sulfite in the running buffer also behaved differently upon the addition of formaldehyde. These results demonstrate how different environments can affect protocells encapsulating similar chemistries and lead to different responses to the same stimulus. Chapter 5 studies H2-driven carbon fixation catalysed by iron sulfides (FeS) in simulated hot spring environments using an anaerobic flow reactor connected to a GC-FID. Results showed that FeS-catalysed carbon fixation was primarily driven by high temperatures (80–120 °C) and could be further enhanced via irradiation with UV–visible light. Among the synthesised FeS samples, pure and Mn-doped FeS showed the highest catalytic activities. Mechanistic studies using in situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations revealed that the reduction occurred via a reverse water–gas shift, which is comparable to the mechanism of the enzymatic acetyl-CoA pathway. The observations herein indicate that FeS-catalysed carbon fixation likely occurred in early Earth hot springs, the mechanism of which may provide insights into the emergence of early metabolic pathways.
Development of activated sorbents for removal and reductive defluorination of PFAS",2024,"Sun, Jun"
"In nature, soft functional materials like human tissue are formed through the supramolecular assembly of biological polymers across the nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale. Harnessing the design rules of these naturally occurring hierarchical structures to synthesise our own functional biomimetic materials is an important research goal spanning multiple fields including supramolecular chemistry, materials science, tissue engineering and medicine. Rational design has allowed us to craft self- assembling peptides with structural similarities to natural materials, but recreating their inherently dynamic functional properties remains challenging. In this thesis, I introduce a short self-assembling peptide based on the tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) motif, which shows multiscale hierarchical ordering leading to emergent dynamic properties in the resulting hydrogels. Initially conceived to serve as a simple monomeric model to study β-tertiary structure and folding, I demonstrate that with minor residue substitutions, the Trpzip motif can be repurposed as the minimal structural unit from which nanofibrous, tissue-mimetic hydrogels can be assembled. Using molecular dynamics simulations to navigate the vast sequence space, I identified, synthesized, and validated a Trpzip variant which formed a self-assembling hydrogel under physiological conditions. I then examined the nanoscale and microscale properties of these Trpzip hydrogels through a variety of spectroscopy, microscopy, and neutron scattering techniques. Next, I characterised the mechanics of pure Trpzip hydrogels, finding that they show tunable viscoelasticity, can shear-thin and self-heal like other supramolecular hydrogels yet display unique yield-stress properties, and demonstrate stress-relaxation behavior reminiscent of native tissue. With a variety of other supramolecular and covalent chemistry approaches, I explore ways to further modulate the mechanical and biochemical profile of Trpzip hydrogels. Finally, a range of cellular and organotypic models were integrated into Trpzip hydrogels to demonstrate their potential as synthetic 3D tissue scaffolds. I show pure Trpzip hydrogels support a variety of mammalian cell types including fibroblasts, myoblasts, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and its rheological properties make the hydrogel amenable to clinical and biofabrication applications such as syringe- based cell delivery and 3D bioprinting. Using various human intestinal organoid models, I show Trpzip hydrogels can support complex yet critical biological processes such as self-organization, morphogenesis, and polarization. Altogether, the research presented in this thesis expands the supramolecular peptide design space, introduces a synthetic biomaterial with potential for use in tissue engineering and medicine, and contributes to our growing understanding of the materials chemistry principles central to recapitulating native tissue matrices.
Design and synthesis of novel biologically active flavones and isoflavones",2024,"Fu, Xiaoming"
"The primary aim of this project was to develop different methodologies for the synthesis of novel 4-arylisoflavans and isoflavenes or analogues that structurally resemble isoflavonoids. In addition, the incorporation of fused-ring systems into the isoflavonoid scaffold to synthesize analogues of a bioactive natural product was also explored. The synthesized analogues were tested against cancer cells with results showing that a number of these compounds displayed promising anti-cancer effects. The construction of 4-arylisoflavan scaffold started with the preparation of phenyl propynyl ethers either by Williamson ether synthesis or Mitsunobu reaction, depending on the electronic nature of the propynyl aromatic systems which were introduced at the terminal alkyne via Sonogashira coupling. The intramolecular cyclization was carried out through an electrophilic borylative reaction followed by immediate esterification to furnish the benzopyran core with a boronic ester at 3-position. Subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction allowed for the attachment of various aromatic systems, giving access to 4-arylisoflavenes which were readily converted to cis 4-arylisoflavans by catalytic hydrogenation. The established methodology paved the way for flexible structural modification and possessed the advantage of preparing a large library of isoflavans in a short period of time. Attempts were also made to improve the bioactivities of 4-arylisoflavans by replacing the benzopyran core with 1,4-benzoxazine, which required the development of an alternative strategy. The synthesis of the benzoxazine ring was achieved by reduction of the nitro group and subsequent reductive amination of readily available precursors 2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrophenoxy)-1-arylethan-1-ones. An additional reduction step using NaCNBH3 was performed to increase amine conversion. The secondary amine present in the benzoxazine iv scaffold was substituted with either aromatic systems via Buchwald-Hartwig crosscoupling or different benzyl moieties. Subsequent functionalization such as amination and demethylation further expanded the substrate scope of 3,4-disubstituted benzoxazines. The synthesis of aza-analogues of 4-arylisoflavenes, or 3,4-disubstituted quinolines and their reduced analogues started with the construction of N-phenyl-2-propynylamines where the amine was protected with a tosyl group. Different aryl substituents were then introduced at the terminal alkyne through Sonogashira coupling reaction. Electrophilic iodocyclization furnished the quinoline scaffold for subsequent coupling at 3-position to afford the tosylated 3,4-diaryl-1,2-dihydroquinolines which were readily converted to desired 3,4-diarylquinolines by convenient deprotection. Furthermore, the catalytic reduction of the tosylated intermediates to generate the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines was also explored.
Development of Daidzein-based Peptide Mimics as Novel Antimicrobial Agents",2024,"Hong, Zijian"
"The swift rise and progression of antibacterial resistance poses a significant global threat to public health. Addressing the escalating incidence of antibacterial resistance requires immediate action, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies and antibacterial agents. Antimicrobial peptidomimetics have gained considerable attention as promising candidates for the development of novel antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance. This research project focuses on utilizing the daidzein scaffold as a foundation for developing antimicrobial peptidomimetics. The synthesis of daidzein-based peptidomimetics was accomplished through a Mannich reaction to attach a piperazine ring, followed by the alkylation of the daidzein hydroxyl groups. Cationic amino acids were then attached to the terminal amino group of the piperazine ring. The antibacterial activity of these peptidomimetics was evaluated by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against various bacterial strains. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that the most potent compound exhibited remarkable antibacterial efficacy, with an MIC of 8 µM against S. aureus and 32 µM against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, these peptidomimetics displayed significant inhibition of S. aureus biofilm formation, with up to 65% inhibition observed at sub-MIC levels. Additionally, they disrupted up to 69% of pre-established S. aureus biofilms at 64 µM. Alternatively, daidzein-based peptidomimetics were synthesized by functionalizing one or both hydroxyl groups with ethyl bromoacetate. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group at C7 of the daidzein scaffold was alkylated with a heptyl chain before substituting the C4' hydroxyl with an ethyl bromoacetate. Subsequent hydrolysis followed by attaching the guanidine with varying alkyl chain lengths as cationic groups gave the targeted peptidomimetics. The most potent peptidomimetics demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive S. aureus, with an MIC of 4 µM, and against E. coli, with an MIC of 63 µM. These active peptidomimetics inhibited up to 55% of S. aureus biofilm formation and disrupted up to 40% of pre-established S. aureus biofilms at sub-MIC levels. Also, these two classes of daidzein-based peptidomimetics disrupted cytoplasmic cell membranes in S. aureus in a dye release assay. They showed low cytotoxicity against mammalian red blood cells, demonstrating their potential for further development as novel antimicrobial agents.
Bio-inspired Design of Hydrogels for Force Mediated Biomolecule Immobilization and Release",2023,"Jayathilaka, Honda"
"External forces play a crucial role in our everyday life and also in natural processes. In mammalian biology, the extracellular matrix (ECM) develops strain in response to force, which leads to numerous activities including molecule synthesis, immobilization, and release. This includes diverse molecular species including matrix proteins, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and growth factors. This thesis reports new approaches to recapitulate these dynamic activities—biomolecule release and immobilization—through synthetic design of hydrogel materials using force-mediated dynamic chemistry. First, I investigated a dynamic hydrogel formed through disulfide bonds using shear rheology, demonstrating reversible, self-healing, stress-relaxing, and other viscoelastic behavior under stress. Integrating a secondary ionically crosslinked alginate network toughened these materials to access a broad range of cyclic loading for mechanochemical activation. The complex rheology of these dynamic materials was shown to be on account of fast dynamics in disulfide exchange under shear. Addition of thiol-containing small molecules contributed to bond breaking with complete dissolution at high concentration. Next, using this knowledge, I developed a multi-layered hydrogel system, the first example of a material where complex hydrogel microenvironments can be dynamically switched through a dissolution mechanism. I developed novel patterning chemistry to form fibronectin protein immobilized patterns on disulfide gels by applying force-mediated thiol-ene Michael addition click chemistry. The bottom layer was micropatterned polyacrylamide of variable stiffness. This model enabled me to tune the stiffness and geometry of the top and the bottom hydrogel independently and together. Addition of cysteine serves to dissolve the top disulfide gel thereby revealing the patterned polyacrylamide. Microenvironmental switching with adherent adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) demonstrated how multiple biophysical cues influence differentiation to divergent lineages. Finally, to demonstrate molecule release from hydrogels, I synthesized an oxanorbornadiene mechanophore, a molecule sensitive to force, and incorporated it into a polyacrylamide-alginate double network. This was the first demonstration of molecule release in response to force in an aqueous environment, with molecular design leading to enhancements in activation at significantly lower forces compared to earlier studies. Together, this thesis provides new avenues for using force to trigger mechanochemical signalling and establishes design criteria for engineering force-sensitive dynamic hydrogel materials with controllable viscoelastic properties for biomedical and biotechnological applications.
Synthetic Chemistry Approaches to Treat Diseases of the Brain",2023,"Adib, Mohiminul"
"Small molecule compounds have been explored for diseases related to the brain. This thesis focused on exploring small molecule candidates that could act as therapeutic options against ischemic stroke and glioblastoma. Although the nature and pathophysiology of these two diseases are different, the therapeutic treatments that have been explored here focused on the fact that whether the candidates could pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to exhibit their action. Chapter 2 and chapter 3 focused on drug candidates against ischemic stroke, and chapter 4 focused on the anticancer treatment option against glioblastoma. Ischemic stroke occurs due to the disruption of blood flow within the blood vessels in the brain. The reason for this disrupted blood flow could be clot formation or a plaque or even air bubbles within the brain's blood vessels. A physiological response to induced hypoxia could protect the neuronal damage after a stroke. The hypoxia response is regulated by an enzyme called prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) which hydroxylates the hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) transcription factors. So, the plan was to synthesize the candidate analogues that could potentially inhibit the active site of PHD2 enzyme so that, stabilized HIF-α promotes a hypoxic response. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of six candidate inhibitors, and prediction of their ability to bind PHD2 through in silico docking studies. Chapter 3 describes the investigation of the neuroprotective activity of selected candidates. This work led to two breakthrough findings: (i) neuroprotective activity is observed even when the drugs are administered 2 h post-injury; and (ii) the candidates' physicochemical properties can be made more suitable for BBB permeability without destroying the cell-based neuroprotective activity. Chapter 4 focused on novel anticancer candidate molecules that could bind to the tumor DNA irreversibly to inhibit tumor resistance. Two proposed scaffolds were explored. The 1st scaffold was an aziridine-based DNA crosslinking agent. The 2nd scaffold was an aziridine-containing agent designed to inhibit the enzyme topoisomerase II. The synthesis route was challenging due to the instability of the aziridine side chain in different reaction conditions. This project has not been explored completely due to time constraints. Overall, this thesis has explored small molecule synthesis followed by investigating promising biological properties to emphasize their potential. Diseases like stroke or glioblastoma can be dreadful and that is why small molecule that can be used to treat these brain disorders would be vitally important. The mechanism of action of these two treatments is different as in one of them (ischemic stroke), the candidate compound should inhibit the target enzyme (PHD2) whereas in the other case (glioblastoma) the aziridine candidate would act on the tumor DNA. In both cases, the target compound should cross the BBB. The next research work of these potential analogues should target whether their appropriate candidate to cross the BBB or not. Furthermore, new analogues should be made and their neuroprotection capability needs to be explored.
Novel antimicrobial strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections",2023,"Browne, Kate"
"Healthcare-associated infections are the most common adverse event affecting hospital patients. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, there is an increasing number of untreatable infections. Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of novel antibacterial strategies to both prevent, and treat, healthcare-associated infections. This thesis explores three key approaches to treat and prevent the transmission of healthcare-associated infections. First of all, a library of novel antibacterial compounds were assessed in vitro for their clinical potential. The compounds with the greatest clinical potential were then tested in various biomaterial applications (biocompatibility in an animal model, and their activity when covalently attached to biomaterial surfaces). Finally, this thesis explores antibacterial strategies to prevent the transmission of bacteria from clinical surfaces. The lead antimicrobial candidates, melimine and RK758, are peptidomimetics that address the drawbacks of conventional antibiotic therapy. They showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (including clinical antibiotic-resistant isolates), anti-biofilm activity and thermal stability. When peptidomimetics were used in combination with traditional antibiotics, bacteria were unable to develop resistance towards antibiotics or peptidomimetics. This combination antibiotic-peptidomimetic therapy also showed synergistic activity, which further increases the potential for these compounds to treat multidrug-resistant infections. When assessed in two clinical applications, peptidomimetics showed promise for their continued clinical development. Both melimine and RK758 were biocompatible in animal models. When peptidomimetics were loaded into bone allograft, there was no inhibition of bone healing in a critical-sized distal femur defect model. Moreover, when these peptidomimetics were covalently attached using a new polydopamine coating method to biomaterial surfaces, they retained their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and prevented biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This thesis also explores the transmission of pathogens from clinical surfaces, and how ultraviolet-C disinfection could be used in healthcare-facilities to reduce the bacterial bioburden on various clinical surfaces. Overall, adjunct ultraviolet disinfection significantly reduced the bioburden on surfaces in operating theatres and clinical rooms. Overall, these three strategies work together to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Preventing the transmission of pathogens from the environment to patients, is known to reduce healthcare-associated infection rates. Furthermore, the development and application of novel-acting antibiotics offers a solution to the antibiotic-resistance crisis and addresses the urgent need for antimicrobials with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. If commercialised, the strategies proposed in this thesis have the potential to increase activity of ineffective antibiotics and prolong their use in the clinic.
Novel antibacterial strategies for bioceramic- and polymer-based orthopaedic biomaterials.",2023,"Chakraborty, Sudip"
"Orthopaedic devices and biomaterials have significantly improved the livelihood of patients suffering from debilitating health conditions and have offered healthcare institutions and governments the tools to intervene for better health outcomes. However, like with many other life-saving technologies, there are challenges hindering the optimal effectiveness of orthopaedic biomaterials, key amongst which is bacterial infections. These infections often result in multiple surgeries and implant failure. Traditional therapeutic strategies that have relied on antibiotics are being challenged by the rapid evolution and prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Therefore, exploring alternative strategies to kill bacteria and reduce medical devices associated infections is the need of the hour. Traditional antibiotics are susceptible to bacterial resistance primarily because of their mechanisms of action which involve identifying and binding to specific targets within bacteria. Alternatives to traditional antibiotics such as antimicrobial peptides and their mimics, quaternary ammonium compounds, antibacterial hydrogels, metal ions, etc., have emerged as potent antibacterial agents, some of which are less susceptible to bacterial resistance due to their non-specific modes of action. In the context of biomedical devices and implants, the attachment strategies employed for tethering antimicrobial compounds to their surfaces play crucial roles in determining the magnitude of antibacterial activity observed on the device surfaces and in the surrounding region. Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition (PIIID) has emerged as an exciting single-step process for attaching molecules to material surfaces. It is relatively easy to perform and successfully generates stable coatings for materials. In this, study, we have explored two small-molecule antimicrobial peptidomimetics, an antimicrobial polymer, two antimicrobial peptides, a quaternary ammonium polymer, and an vi antimicrobial hydrogel as coatings and fillings for hydroxyapatite (HA) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) surfaces. We have explored two strategies for attachment of these compounds to the materials, physical attachment via weak interactions and covalent attachment via PIIID treatment. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the attachment and properties of the peptidomimetics-based coatings for HA surfaces while chapter 4 details the properties of the polymer-based coatings for the same. Chapter 5 deals with the two antimicrobial peptides and chapter 6 talks about the quaternary ammonium polymer-based coating and the antimicrobial hydrogel-based filling for HA discs. Finally, chapter 7 describes the properties of peptidomimetics and polymer-coated PEEK sheets. Overall, several non-traditional strategies for generating antibacterial coatings for materials of relevance in orthopaedics were investigated. All the compounds demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity and were successful in inhibiting the attachment of bacteria (S. aureus (peptidomimetics, peptides, quaternary ammonium polymer and hydrogel), E. coli (polymer, peptides, and hydrogels) and P. aeruginosa (peptides)) to the material surfaces and in the surrounding solution. The covalently coated surfaces could retain their activity over a prolonged period of time while the physically coated surfaces exhibited significant activity immediately after the coating. These compounds and attachment strategies represent exciting alternatives to traditional therapeutic strategies.
Protein-ligand interactions in native mass spectrometry: Applications in medicinal and environmental chemistry",2023,"Pham, Phuong Chi"
"Protein-ligand interactions play a crucial role in various biological processes of living organisms. Thus, characterising protein-ligand interactions is important for understanding the mechanism of ligands in signalling pathways as well as developing novel drugs. This thesis describes the application of native mass spectrometry (MS) to studying protein-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry and environmental chemistry, and the use of additives to stabilise the proteinligand complexes in the gas phase for improved native MS measurements. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of peptides targeting heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). Hsp27's main function is to bind misfolded proteins and prevent them from aggregating. However, the aberrant activity of Hsp27 has been implicated in numerous diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. An analogue of peptides derived from the N-terminal domain of Hps27 was identified to bind to Hsp27 using native MS for the first time. To date, these are also the smallest peptides reported to bind to Hsp27 and affect citrate synthase aggregation. This native MS approach may be useful for identifying other promising compounds targeting Hsp27. The aim of the research detailed in Chapter 3 is to identify per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that can bind to the major whey protein β-lactoglobulin (BLG) in bovine milk. PFASs are a topic of global health concern owing to their persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation and toxic effects in humans and animals. Native MS was used to investigate the binding affinities and the binding site of PFASs to BLG. Six out of 19 of the PFASs investigated can bind strongly to two isoforms of BLG at the same binding site as endogenous ligands. These results demonstrate a potential route for the bioaccumulation of PFASs in cow milk and an approach to remove PFASs from BLG. Chapter 4 aims to investigate the effect of the Hofmeister series of anions on protein-ligand interactions in native MS. For β-lactoglobulin and stearic acid system, the addition of citrate and tartrate to the ESI solutions resulted in significant stabilisation of the complex such that the binding affinities increased by a respective 42% and 40% compared to using ammonium acetate alone. For lysozyme binding to tri-N-acetylchitotriose, bromide and thiocyanate dramatically decreased the dissociation constants especially at lower charge states. Therefore, some specific anions can be added to the solution to stabilise protein-ligand complexes in the gas phase and improve their dissociation constants.
Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel Pseudomonas Quinolone Quorum Sensing (PQS) Inhibitors as Antimicrobial Agents",2022,"Sabir, Shekh"
"Quorum sensing (QS) in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) plays a critical role in biofilm development and production of numerous virulence factors which has ultimately led to the development of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Therefore, the development of small molecules which can inhibit bacterial QS without affecting bacterial growth could be an effective strategy to overcome anti-microbial resistance. 
The primary objective of the work described in this thesis was the development of novel small molecules that can inhibit Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) based quorum sensing signaling in P. aeruginosa. To inhibit PQS biosynthesis, by using the ligand-based drug-design approach, novel triazole-nucleoside containing anthraniloyl adenosine monophosphate mimics were designed and synthesized to target enzyme anthraniloyl-CoA synthetase (PqsA), which is involved in the first step in quinolone biosynthesis, A total of 14 anthraniloyl-adenosine monophosphate derivatives were synthesized using a multi-step synthetic route and screened for quorum sensing inhibition activity. To develop dihydropyrrol-2-ones (DHPs) as PqsR antagonists by modifications at the exocyclic double bond, a method for mono-bromination at the vinylic position was developed using a 1,3-dibromo-5,5- dimethylhydantoin reagent. In a subsequent reaction, brominated DHPs were converted to thioether-linked analogues using mild reaction conditions. The screening results showed that the 2-mercaptopyridyl analogue 7g exhibits PqsR antagonist activity with IC50 32 µM. The molecular docking study reveals that 7g interacts with the ligand-binding domain of PqsR. In addition, it was found that brominated DHPs can be converted into corresponding selenourea and thiourea derivatives under mild reaction conditions. Therefore, a series of novel selenourea and thiourea containing analogues were synthesized and tested for QSI and anti-bacterial activities. Interestingly, selenium DHPs showed comparatively more activity than the corresponding sulfur derivatives. The most active compound 3e showed 53% QSI activity at 31 µM in Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 15.6 µM against Gram-positive S. aureus. In search of the quinolone-based competitive antagonists of PqsR, disulfide bond containing novel quinazolinone derivatives were designed by using a ligand-based drug-design approach. By varying the aliphatic side chain and substitution around the heterocyclic ring, a small library of disulfide derivatives was synthesized. The most active derivative 8q showed promising activity against pqs QS system with IC50 of 4.5 µM in the P. aeruginosa pqsA:gfp reporter based assay. In addition, 8q showed complete suppression of pyocyanin production as well as moderate activity against P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in PAO1 and PA14 strains. Furthermore, 8q potentiates antibacterial activities of known antibiotics ciprofloxacin and tobramycin when used in combination. Finally, the molecular docking study revealed that 8q exhibits identical orientation and binding interaction as a natural ligand in the ligand-binding domain of PqsR.
SYNTHETIC PROCEDURE OF NOVEL ANTICANCER COMPOUNDS BASED ON 1,4-NAPHTHOQUINONES",2022,"Jones, John"
"The primary aim of this thesis was to synthesize optimised versions of a lead compound 2-chloro-3-((2-morpholinomethyl)amino)naphalene-1,4-dione (BH10) bearing the naphthoquinone scaffold as the primary pharmacophore to inhibit the growth of malignant tumours in human tissue. The starting material used for the synthesis sequence is a 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone, that was chosen for the ease with which the chlorine substituents can be substituted for various functional groups to form mono-substituted, disubstituted, and tricyclic versions of the original scaffold. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the malignant condition, its mechanisms, and metabolic processes that distinguish it from healthy tissues. The origins of the naphthoquinone scaffold are described in brief and a discussion of the mechanisms that allow it to act as an anticancer agent is provided. The procedures for substituting and forming a tricyclic ring system from the naphthoquinone scaffold is depicted, with optimisation strategy and aims revealed. Chapter 2 depicts naphthoquinone libraries with optimised monosubstituted linker systems. A two-step synthesis plan was applied that first exchanges the C3 chlorine for a propargylamine, second, the scaffold is subjected to a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to form a 1,2,3-triazole ring system with various pendant phenyl substituents. The second compound synthesized for this library having a carboxylic acid substituted to the pendant phenyl was found to impart poor solubility to the scaffold, thus, esterification procedures were applied to obtain various esters aimed at increasing solubility of the structure. Chapter 3 depicts the disubstituted amine naphthoquinones and tricyclic imidazole compound libraries. The synthetic pathway to afford the disubstituted amines was a three-step procedure involving exchange of the C2 chlorine for an amine followed by the addition of a trifluoroacetyl group under neat conditions. A Michael addition was then used to substitute the C3 chlorines with one of two linker types. The first analogue exhibited a propargylamine linker, the second a 3-(piperidin-1-yl)propan-1-amine. The tricyclic naphthoquinones with substituted trifluoromethyl imidazoles were first formed by heating the reaction mixture to induce ring formation of a disubstituted analogue, however, low yield and long reaction time prompted the search for an alternative pathway to produce the tricyclic scaffold. A three-step synthetic procedure was then devised. Firstly, the 2,3-chlorine substituents were replaced by phthalimido protecting groups. Secondly, the protecting groups were removed to reveal a 2,3-diamine version of the naphthoquinone scaffold 35. Thirdly, the scaffold was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to complete a tricyclic imidazole intermediate. The antitumor activity of the structure was then fine-tuned by introducing various linkers including 1,2,3-triazole and pendant phenyls attached to the imidazole. Chapter 4 depicts the resulting new structures that were selected for in-vitro toxicology studies. The compounds were tested in human endometrial cancer HEC1A cells, and non-cancerous human endometrial stromal MAD-11 cells to assess their potential as anticancer agents. A comprehensive interpretation of the procedure is described. The results indicated the trifluoromethyl addition to the scaffolds to have had a positive impact on the cytotoxic activity of the naphthoquinone structure, while the attachment of a linker to the imidazole consisting of a 1,2,3-triazole with 1-butyl piperidine substituent-maintained good selectivity. From all compounds synthesized, three were selected for in-vivo PK studies, also discussed in this chapter. A key objective of the PK studies was to determine if the optimisations applied to the compounds had improved on the existing BH10 and analogues tested previously. The study was conducted using C57BL/6 mice that were subjected to the drugs prepared in a mixture of methylcellulose/tween80. The drugs were administered by oral gavage and blood was drawn from the tail at regular intervals over 8-time points, the bloods were then centrifuged to precipitate the protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of each sample and drug standards (spiked into the blood) were quantified and used to generate plasma concentration over time plots that enabled the pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs to include maximum plasma concentration Cmax, t1/2 life, and area under the curve (AUC) values. All three of these parameters were located for two of the three drugs tested, and although a substantial increase for the t1/2 life did not result, the Cmax values were found to be >10 times that of BH10 and >5 times that of the recommended analogue 13a. Subsequently, both candidates were observed to maintain a therapeutic dose in the blood for longer periods than the lead BH10 and all analogues. Both compounds are recommended for further analysis consisting of liver microsome to determine clearance, plasma protein binding assay to inform the drug fraction free in circulation, not bound to albumin, and free to enter cells. It is also recommended that two compounds be formulated for slow-release or pegylation. Chapter 5 depicts various miscellaneous synthetic procedures that were conducted for various reasons. To begin, the addition of an aliphatic dimethyl amino linker to the 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone was carried out to determine its exchangeability with the chlorines on this scaffold. A synthetic procedure is then described that affords a tricyclic imidazole with 1,2,3-triazole linker with no pendant moiety added to the scaffold. This compound was synthesised for the purpose of defining the effect that the pendant moieties have on the anticancer activity of the scaffold. An alternative synthesis plan to afford 1,2,3-triazole with pendant phenyl linkers is also described, and a synthetic pathway to afford thiazoles is depicted. The procedure to obtain the thiazole was extracted from a patent describing the formulation of compounds to treat the hepatitis B virus. The intention was to substitute the thiazole onto the naphthoquinone scaffold as an additional optimised linker plan. Chapters 6 depicts conclusions and recommendations, and chapter 7 contains the experimental details. To conclude, chapter 8 depicts thesis references, and chapter 9 provides an appendix with MTT assay viability plots and H-NMR spectra not seen in previous chapters.
Nanocatalytic CePO4·H2O (Rhabdophane): Mitochondrial-Targeting, Cell-Discriminative, ROS-Mediated Cancer Therapy",2022,"Amaldoss, Maria John Newton"
"Nanocatalytic tumor therapies involve established strategies to increase the concentration of endogenous oxygen species (ROS) H2O2 to cytotoxic levels. These strategies are based on increasing the ROS levels through stimuli from drugs, the action of ROS-producing agents, and nanoparticulate catalysis. However, these techniques frequently are indiscriminatory, being cytotoxic to diseased cells and normal cells alike, leading to significant unwanted side-effects. The present work reports a new paradigm strategy based upon the catalytic action of a cell-discriminative, ROS-mediating, autophagy-suppressive nanoparticle, which is CePO4·H2O (rhabdophane). CePO4·H2O nanoparticles were synthesised using CeNO3·6H2O precipitated in an aqueous solution of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) at room temperature. The nanoparticles were well crystallised, equiaxed (~10-35 nm), of positive surface charge, and of general valence ratio 〖""Ce"" 〗_""0.8"" ^""3+"" 〖""Ce"" 〗_""0.2"" ^""4+"" 〖""PO"" 〗_""4.1"" . Materials characterisation involved particuological (hydrodynamic particle size, surface area, zeta potential), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction, laser Raman microspectroscopy), chemical (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), structural (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and microstructural (transmission electron microscopy) analyses. Biological characterisation involved examination of the effects on HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MRC-5 normal fibroblasts in terms of cellular interactions (cell viability by MTT assay), cellular uptake and trafficking (confocal laser scanning microscopy, biological transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry), ROS generation (confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry), apoptosis (annexin V-FITC assay), gene expression (q-RT-PRC), and protein expression (western blot analyses). The key observations and conclusions from the biological evaluation are as follows: Discriminative Cytotoxicity: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first to exhibit discriminative cytotoxicity: At 24 h, fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell viability is ~10% but MRC-5 normal cell viability is ~45%. Discriminative Uptake: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first, without the use of a targeting ligand, to be internalized readily by cancer cells but scarcely by normal cells. Self-Targeting: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are trafficked toward the mitochondrial environment and possibly the converse trafficking. Mitochondrial Starvation: The preceding proximity between CePO4·H2O nanoparticles and cancer cell leads to increased phosphate concentration in the cellular environment, the concentration gradient of which effectively starves the mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial stress and dysfunction. Discriminative ROS Generation: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first to demonstrate elevated cellular ROS in cancer cells by multiple mechanisms while normal cells exhibit only a low level of such elevation. Autophagy Suppression: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles suppress autophagy, thereby increasing cellular stress and suppressing cancer cell survival, thus offering a complement to mitochondrial starvation. Redox Switching: CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are the first nonmetallic nanoparticles to balance redox switching through simple electronic charge compensation rather than more complex ionic charge compensation. Biocompatibility: As hydrated phosphates, CePO4·H2O nanoparticles are more biocompatible than metals or oxides, suggesting greater feasibility of renal clearance. These advantages derive from the key role of the redox and defect equilibria arising from the oxidation reaction Ce3+ → Ce4+ + e′, which is induced by the acidic pH environment of the cancer call versus the stability of the Ce3+ valence in the basic pH environment of the normal cell. The former both elevates the ROS level and disrupts the electron transfer chain. Ultimately, the suppression of the proliferation of cancer cells derives from the cross-talk involving cellular ROS elevation, autophagy suppression, and their mitochondrial control.
Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Phenylglyoxamide- and Benzothiazole-Based Small Molecular Peptidomimetics as Antibacterial Agents",2022,"Yu, Tsz Tin"
"The rapid emergence and development of antibacterial resistance is a major global threat to public health. There is an urgent need for the development of antibacterial agents with novel therapeutic strategy to tackle the increasing incidence of antibacterial resistance. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their synthetic mimics have been under the spotlight of the development of a novel class of antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance. This research project focused on the utilisation of phenylglyoxamide and benzothiazole scaffolds in the development of antimicrobial peptidomimetics. The synthesis of phenylglyoxamide-based peptidomimetics was achieved via the ring-opening reactions of N-sulfonylisatins with primary amines followed by salt formation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the peptidomimetics against different bacterial strains were determined to assess their antibacterial activity. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed the inverse relationship between the alkylsulfonyl chain length and the bulkiness of the phenyl ring system for high antibacterial activity. The most active peptidomimetics exhibited high antibacterial activity with the lowest MIC to be 4, 16 and 63 μM against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. These peptidomimetics also showed significant biofilm disruption (up to 50%) and inhibition (up to 70%) against S. aureus at 2–4× MIC. In addition, terphenylglyoxamide-based peptidomimetics synthesised by the ring-opening reaction of N-acylisatins with amines and amino acid esters were evaluated for their quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) activity against P. aeruginosa MH602. The most potent peptidimimetic possessed high QSI activity of 82%, 65% and 53% at 250, 125 and 62.5 μM, respectively, with no bacterial growth inhibition. On the other hand, benzothiazole-based peptidomimetics were synthesised via the Jacobson method of cyclisation of phenylthioamides, followed by the installation of cationic groups. 2-Naphthyl and guanidinium hydrochloride as the hydrophobic and cationic groups, respectively, were important for high antibacterial activity of the peptidomimetics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most potent peptidomimetics against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa possessed MIC values of 2, 16 and 32 μM, respectively. These active peptidomimetics inhibited 39% of S. aureus biofilm formation and disrupted 42% of preformed S. aureus biofilms at sub-MIC.
Development of novel ubiquitin specific protease 5 (USP5) inhibitors to treat neuroblastoma",2022,"Gadde, Satyanarayana"
"High-risk neuroblastoma is one of the most aggressive and treatment-refractory childhood malignancies. MYCN (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived) is a major oncogenic driver for neuroblastoma (NB) tumorigenesis. Developing direct inhibitors of MYCN has been challenging due to several limitations. Hence, targeting MYCN-binding proteins which regulate the stability of MYCN protein is a promising alternative approach. This study is aimed at developing novel inhibitors of ubiquitin specific protease 5 (USP5), a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is known to prevent MYCN protein degradation by deubiquitination. The first results chapter describes the synthesis of novel pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole compounds and their cytotoxicity against MYCN amplified NB cells with high expression of USP5 protein (SK-N-BE(2)-C and Kelly cells). However, none of the tested compounds displayed better cytotoxicity than the parental compound, SE486-11. The second results chapter describes a one-pot synthesis of novel γ-carbolinone, γ-carboline and spiro[pyrrolidinone-3,3′]indoles. One of the γ-carboline compounds (42d) displayed promising cytotoxicity against NB cells (SK-N-BE(2)-C (IC50 = 1.21 μM) and Kelly (IC50 = 3.09 μM)) but showed little therapeutic selectivity when compared to normal human fibroblasts, MRC-5 cells (IC50 = 3.75μM). The synthesis and cytotoxicity of novel pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles is described in the third results chapter. The active compound, 65a displayed promising cytotoxicity against SK-N-BE(2)-C (IC50 = 0.78 μM) and Kelly (IC50 = 2.00 μM) cells with a reasonable therapeutic window compared to MRC-5 cells (IC50 = 15.0 μM). 65a bound to USP5 protein by microscale thermophoresis assay (Kd = 0.47 µM). USP5 and MYCN protein levels were decreased in NB cells by treatment with 65a. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of 65a was dependant on the expression of USP5 and MYCN proteins. 65a showed synergy in combination with HDAC inhibitors, SAHA and panobinostat. In the fourth results chapter, the synthesis of more potent pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles with di- and tri- substitutions on the pendant phenyl ring (86b (SK-N-BE(2)-C IC50 = 0.31 μM; Kelly IC50 = 0.65 μM) and 91 (SK-N-BE(2)-C IC50 = 0.03 μM; Kelly IC50 = 0.07 μM)) are described. Importantly, 86b displayed significant in vivo efficacy in TH-MYCN homozygous NB mice when treated with 60 mg/kg for three weeks. The last results chapter describes the synthesis and cytotoxicity of novel benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole and pyrido[2,3-b]indole compounds. Collectively, this thesis identifies promising novel scaffolds with great potential for further development.
3D Printing of Carbon Nanomaterials Reinforced Nanocomposites with a Novel Visible Light Photoinitiator System",2021,"Wang, Guannan"
"A series of 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (1,5-DAAQ)-based visible-light-sensitive three-component photoinitiator systems (PISs) were developed, which can efficiently initiate the free radical photopolymerization of (meth)acrylates under green light delivered from a light-emitting diode (LED). The PISs contain three components: 1,5-DAAQ, an iodonium salt, and aromatic amines. Polymerization could be efficiently initiated and completed within 10-60s with double bond conversions of approximately up to 80%. The 1,5-DAAQ/iodonium salt/4-N,N-trimethylaniline PIS could be readily employed in the 3D printing process of carbon nanomaterials reinforced polymer nanocomposites. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) were modified to increase its dispersibility via several different surface functionalization methods, such as oxidation, polymer grafting, polymer wrapping, etc. The potential application of the Passerini reaction for surface modification of carbon nanomaterials was explored. The advantage of this approach is the surface grafting reaction can be carried out in any solvent, although here, the reaction will be carried out in water. Any polymer with an aldehyde end functionality can be grafted, but we chose here poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm). This hydrophilic polymer may favorably interact with ethylene glycol of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), which will 3D printed with bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (Bis-GMA) under green light to generate GO or CNTs-containing nanocomposites. The potential application of polydopamine (PDA) as a photosensitizer to graft polymer on its surface have also been investigated. The advantage of PDA is the ability to adhere to any shape and surface and can be used as pre-coating of carbon nanomaterials for polymer grafting. PDA behavior with different redox states under different wavelengths of light has been studied. This thesis will provide some new approaches in surface modification of carbon nanomaterials, development of novel visible light PISs and production of 3D printable nanocomposites under visible light.
Surface Modified Cellulose Nanomaterials : A Source of Non-Spherical Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery",2021,"Khine, Yee Yee"
"Cellulose nanomaterials are excellent carriers to deliver therapeutics as they are biocompatible and have a desirable non-spherical shape. However, these materials display low solubility in aqueous media and need to be modified with water-soluble polymers to achieve high colloidal stability. A critical challenge is to perform efficient surface modification without disrupting the original properties of cellulose. In this study, we modified TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers bearing carboxylic acid moieties (CNFs) by two different routes: nitrile imine/mediated tetrazole/carboxylic acid ligation (NICAL), and three-component Passerini reaction. The advantage of these reactions is the direct functionalization of CNFs under ambient conditions in aqueous media so that additional modification or solvent exchange process prior to surface grafting can be avoided. The NICAL reaction was performed under UV irradiation at λ = 326 nm for 10 hr, resulting in the self-fluorescent polymer grafted CNFs. On the other hand, Passerini reaction is regarded as an effective functionalization approach, which can be carried out in the presence of three components: an acid, an aldehyde and an isocyanide under mild reaction conditions, with a yield of 36 % grafting efficiency within 30 min. In this thesis, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was employed to generate polymers with functional end groups. At last, the cellulose-based nanomaterials with covalently tethered functional polymer chains on the surface (PHEA37-Cy5-PDMAEA12)-g-CNFs were designed to bind and release immunostimulator/chemokines (MIP-1α). The drug carriers were non-toxic against MCF-7 cancer cell lines and successfully up-taken by in vitro (both 2D and 3D) cancer cell models. The physical, chemical and biological properties of nanoparticles were performed by a variety of characterization techniques including FT-IR, TGA, UV-Vis, XRD, LSCM, and flow cytometry.
High performance ion formation, separation, and focusing at ambient pressure for mass spectrometry",2021,"Ahmed, Ezaz"
"Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful method for the rapid, selective, and sensitive analysis of a wide range of molecules. Typically, high performance ion separation and focusing occurs at reduced pressures, which requires complex and bulky vacuum systems. Thus, the development of approaches for the high-performance formation, separation, and focusing of ions at ambient pressures is desirable. Here, methods and instrumentation for forming, separating, and focusing ions at atmospheric pressure were developed. To form ions at ambient pressure, dielectric barrier discharge ionization (DBDI) is an emerging approach. However, conventional DBDI methods produce background ions in relatively high abundances which can limit analytical performance. Here, we demonstrated that high voltage pulses as short as ~100 ns with a ~900 µs delay between pulses can greatly decrease background chemical noise and increase performance in terms of signal-to-noise, sensitivity, and detection limits for small molecule analysis compared to the use of more conventional microsecond pulses. For ion separation, a high-definition differential ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (DMS-MS) method was developed for the rapid separation of perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) isomers at ambient pressure. Chromatography-based MS methods are commonly used to separate structural PFAS isomers. However, they require long analysis times (min to h). Here, we demonstrated that DMS-MS can be employed for high performance separation and detection of linear and branched PFAS isomers at atmospheric pressure in a separation process that occurs in less than 3 minutes. For focusing ions at ambient pressure, ideally every analyte molecule in a sample should be converted into ions that can be detected by MS. However, major ion losses (> 99%) occur resulting from the ion cloud expansion when transferring from high to low pressures. Here, an ambient pressure ion funnel was developed, which can be used to significantly improve ion abundances, sensitivity, and detection limits in electrospray ionization MS compared to the 'normal' operation of electrospray ionization MS. Overall, this research contributes to the development of methods for the high-performance formation, separation, and focusing of ions at high pressures, which may be useful in the future for the development of high performance portable spectrometers for chemical analysis.
Pulsed nanoelectrospray ionisation mass spectrometry",2021,"Liu, Qinwen"
"Pulsed nanoelectrospray ionisation (pulsed nESI) is an emerging technique for ionising volatile biomolecules for sensitive detection by mass spectrometry (MS). In conventional nESI, direct current high voltage (DC HV) is applied to the analyte solution resulting in the formation of ions with high sensitivity, low sample consumption and low limits of detection. Alternatively, in pulsed nESI, molecules are ionized by using a pulsed high voltage square waveform. During the course of this research project, another group reported that pulsed nESI can be used to measure peptide and protein ions by applying short, repetitive pulses of high voltage to the nESI emitter. However, the performance of such an ion source was not compared to conventional nESI. Thus, the extent that pulsed nESI can be used to improve performance of MS was unclear. Here, pulsed nESI is reported in which the voltage is rapidly pulsed from 0 to up to ~3 kV with a rise time of low to sub-nanoseconds and with duty cycles ranging from 1-50% corresponding to pulse durations of 9 to 450 μs. By use of pulsed nESI, the performance of MS for the detection of many different classes of molecules can be improved in terms of decreasing background chemical noise and enhancing the sensitivity for analytes ranging from small molecules to whole proteins. Specifically, pulses that are less than ~450 μs can be used to decrease the background chemical noise and increase signal-to-background chemical noise ratio by up to 93% and 691% in pulsed nESI MS for six test analytes compared to conventional nESI. Pulsed nESI can also be used for native mass spectrometry to improve signal-to- background chemical noise ratios. Overall, pulsed nESI can be used to significantly improve the performance of MS.
Investigating cyclic peptide inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90): from design and synthesis to cellular drug delivery",2020,"Rahimi, Marwa N."
"This thesis describes the synthetic development and biological investigation of a new class of cyclic peptide inhibitors that target heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) interactions with companion proteins known as co-chaperones. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the foundation for all biological activities. The interaction networks formed by multi-protein complexes propels regulatory and structural intracellular processes. The ubiquitous involvement of PPI's in virtually all biological systems represents great scope for therapeutic modulation of PPIs in disease, making them a highly promising target in drug discovery. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a nodal protein that forms hundreds of interactions with client proteins and co-chaperones and is central to many crucial biochemical networks in the cell. Previous strategies in inhibiting Hsp90's crucial oncogenic functions through N-terminal inhibition led to marked failures, with promising compounds exhibiting significant toxicity and developing resistance in clinical trials. Progress in computational sciences has led However, targeting the C-terminus MEEVD region provides a new opportunity for inhibiting Hsp90 without inducing the negative effects observed with N-terminal inhibitors. Firstly, the trends in pharmaceutical development and causes of attrition in drug development are discussed, followed by an evaluation of the complex and diverse nature of PPI therapeutic targets. In particular, the dynamic and modular nature of Hsp90 interactions with co-chaperones are investigated to determine the feasibility of possible inhibitory strategies. Secondly, the novel class of Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors termed LB is explored in a structure activity relationship study to identify key residues important for biological activity. In chapter 3, the lead molecule LB76 is carried forward to evaluate its specificity to the Hsp90 protein target, confirm binding site on said protein and investigated for its ability to halt key functions of Hsp90. Finally, in chapter 4, the lead molecules LB76 and controls are taken forward to endeavour cell entry strategies using polymeric nanoparticles.
Disrupting Chemical Communication in Bacteria: Design and Synthesis of new Quorum Sensing Inhibitors",2020,"Almohaywi, Basmah"
"Bacterial infections, particularly hospital-acquired infections caused by resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have become a global threat with a high mortality rate. Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa employ N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as chemical signals to regulate the expression of pathogenic phenotypes through a mechanism called quorum sensing (QS). Recently, strategies targeting QS have received great attention due to their ability to disarm rather than kill pathogenic bacteria, which lowers the evolutionary burden on bacteria to develop resistance. Halogenated lactones and fimbrolides from marine algae exhibit antimicrobial activities against several bacterial species by reducing the expression of pathogenic phenotypes. Related dihydropyrrol-2-one (DHP) analogues, which bear a nitrogen atom in place of the oxygen in the heterocyclic ring, are more hydrolytically stable under physiological conditions compared to the corresponding lactones. This thesis focused on the design and synthesis of novel derivatives of dihydropyrrolone as QS inhibitors based on three different scaffolds. The quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) activity of the synthesised compounds was determined against a P. aeruginosa MH602 reporter strain. Computational docking studies were performed using a crystal structure of the LasR receptor protein of P. aeruginosa. The first study focused on the synthesis of N-alkyl- and N-aryl 3,4-dichloro- and 3,4-dibromopyrrole-2-one derivatives through the reductive amination of mucochloric and mucobromic acid with aliphatic and aromatic amines. The phenolic compounds exhibited the best activity with up to 80% QSI at 250 μM, The second study focused on the design and synthesis of novel 5-methylene-4-aryl-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-ones. A simple and efficient procedure for the synthesis of N-aryl 5-methylene-4-aryl-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one derivatives has been developed through copper-mediated C-N bond formation. The synthetic protocol allows for versatile and robust C-N arylation with a range of readily available boronic acids under mild conditions. Further modifications of the dihydropyrrolone (DHP) scaffold focusing on five features around the DHP motif were investigated and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of 53 DHP compounds were comprehensively analysed and studied. In a third study, a range of novel acetylene derivatives of dihydropyrrolone were synthesised via Sonogashira coupling reactions between brominated dihydropyrrolones and alkynes. Some of the acetylene compounds showed promising QSI activity against P. aeruginosa.
Glyoxylamide- and Anthranilamide-based Self-assembled Hydrogels for Antibacterial Therapy",2020,"Aldilla, Vina"
"Bacterial infection is a major problem world-wide that not only threatens public health but also causes heavy economic burdens. This problem is made worse by the rise in antimicrobial resistance in consequence of over-prescription and improper use of antimicrobial agents. Thus, development of alternative antimicrobials and their formulation has become an urgent need. Hydrogels are biomaterials that can be endowed with antimicrobial function by incorporating another active agent or through their self-assembled component. However, current hydrogels have some limitations such as lack of chemical diversity, toxicity, and undesired burst-release of bioactive agents. This work explores the synthesis of glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides as self-assembled gels and their antibacterial potency. The glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides were synthesised via ring-opening reactions of N-acylisatins and isatoic anhydride, respectively, with L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine in solution phase. These short peptides successfully formed hydrogels at relatively low concentrations (0.08 - 0.20% w/v) and their properties were characterised using various spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. Hydrogels made from glyoxylamide-based short peptide exhibited high loading capacity (40% w/w), a sustained release profile, and capability to retain the antibacterial efficacy of ciprofloxacin (an antibacterial) against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. On the other hand, hydrogels developed from anthranilamide-based short peptides exhibited inherent antibacterial activity by showing significant bacterial reductions against S. aureus. Importantly, the majority of glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based hydrogels demonstrated low toxicity against mammalian cells. The current study also investigated the potential of anthranilamide-based short peptides for nitric oxide (NO) delivery. The hydrogel formed from anthranilamide-based hydrogel bearing NO donor, as the antibacterial agent, displayed an effective photo-generation of NO radicals (NO•) upon illumination by light. Furthermore, the release of NO was detected using the Griess assay and demonstrated light-dependent NO release which was also evidenced in the in vitro antibacterial assay against E. coli. Glyoxylamide- and anthranilamide-based short peptides, therefore, showed the potential to be used as an antibacterial material to treat infections.
Development of bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme inhibitors and total synthesis of an archaea signalling molecule",2020,"Wenholz, Daniel"
"With the rise of antimicrobial resistance as a significant global health threat the need for therapeutic agents with novel modes of action has become increasingly urgent. The primary aim of this thesis was the development of antibacterial compounds capable of inhibiting RNA polymerase holoenzyme formation as well as an investigation into the total synthesis of an archaea signalling molecule in pursuit of a new scaffold for bacterial quorum sensing inhibitors. To aid in the identification and optimisation of RNA polymerase holoenzyme inhibitors an in silico dynamic protein surface docking protocol was developed. This computational tool was used to screen and develop compounds from both complex-based pharmacophore and hybridisation studies between 2-benzamidobenzoic acids and activated 1H-indoles of the GKL series of inhibitors. Optimisation of the identified lead scaffolds led to the discovery of compounds with potent antibacterial activities, possessing minimum inhibitory concentrations as low as 1.7 μg/mL against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and up to 86% inhibition of in vitro bacterial DNA transcription at 20 μM. A fluorescence microscopy study further supported the proposed mechanism of action as inhibition of DNA transcription. Furthermore, the incorporation of amine groups into the hybrid scaffold was found to overcome intrinsic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria due to a lack of permeability through the outer cell membrane. The total synthesis of a proposed structure of an archaea signalling molecule was successfully achieved in 12-steps. However, significant differences were observed between the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the natural product extract and the synthesised proposed structure. An investigation of the original extract led to the identification of the major component of the isolate. A secondary aim was also the investigation of the intermolecular interactions of activated 1H-benzotriazoles structurally related to the GKL inhibitor scaffold.
Understanding and Utilising Electrochemical Control Over Single Molecule Fluorescence for Biosensor Application",2020,"Fan, Sanjun"
"Biosensors are analytical devices with a biological sensing element, capable of convenient, rapid, accurate detection of a variety of biological interactions and components such as tissues, cells, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, microorganisms. In this work, affinity sensors are our focus, and it is of great importance to decrease the nonspecific bindings, as they can interfere with the analytes signal. To reduce the signal from nonspecific binding of proteins to the sensing surface, the surface can be blocked with ""antifouling biomolecules"" such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) or synthetic molecules such as polyethylene oxides (PEGs). However, these ""antifouling biomolecules"" have disadvantages with regards to instability or high impedance. Phenyl phosphoryl choline (PPC), as a promising anti-fouling choice, can be grafted via electrochemical diazonium reaction, exhibiting lower impedance, and excellent anti-fouling effect. But, in common with BSA and PEGs, the surface chemistry resists nonspecific adsorption of protein but is not capable of completely preventing nonspecific binding, and this can be significant when the biomarker of interest is only a minor component of the sample for analysis. Therefore, the aim of the proposed research is to apply two layers of resistance to nonspecific adsorption of protein by combining PPC modification of electrodes with a new concept referred to as electric field pulsing. The idea of electric field pulsing relies on proteins having charge such that pulsing the potential of electrodes from positive to negative of potential-of-zero charge will attract and repel proteins. Firstly, a variety of dyes including rhodamine dyes, cyanine dyes, oxazine dyes, quantum dots, and fluorescent proteins were investigated in electrochemistry aiming to find dyes that is insensitive to external potentials. Secondly, it was hoped that by exploring pulse duration specific binding events can be promoted and nonspecific binding events were reduced. To do this, indium tin oxide (ITO) was electrochemically modified with antifouling molecules (PPC) and then nonspecific adsorption of fluorescently labelled human serum albumin (HSA) was quantitively monitored using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy under pulsing potential control. It was expected the HSA would be repelled/attracted from/to the surface by applying different potential, leading to a better selectivity. Finally, in the future, the sensing interface with antifouling molecular layers will be configured with an antibody-antigen complex so that specific and nonspecific binding events can be probed in whole blood.
Structure–Activity Relationships for Carbonyl Photolysis",2020,"Rowell, Keiran"
"Photolysis drives the formation of all radicals in the atmosphere. Carbonyls are photoactive and ubiquitous in the atmosphere as the oxidative degradation products of all volatile organic compounds. The structural diversity of carbonyls poses a challenge to atmospheric models, as experimental photolysis parameters are available for only a small subset of atmospheric species. In this work, photolysis structure-activity relationships (SARs) are derived for the carbonyl moiety as a whole, using quantum chemical calculations that are extensively validated to be accurate to within 10 kJ/mol of experimental data. All photolysis pathways on the electronic states accessible in the 300–330 nm tropospheric wavelength range (S1, T1, and S0) are calculated for 20 representative carbonyl species across 7 structurally distinct classes. An additional 18 larger carbonyl species are used to study the Norrish Type II (NTII) reaction. The B2GP-PLYP double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) method is used for the S0 and T1 states. Inexpensive composite protocols are formulated for predicting S1 energies, using systematic trends in equation of motion coupled cluster vertical excitation energies, and affordable (time-dependent) DFT methods for geometries and vibrational frequencies. Norrish Type I α-bond photolysis thresholds are rationalised as an interplay of hyperconjugation and α-bond delocalisation effects. The inaccessibility of S1 photolysis thresholds, and the alternate bond cleavage in α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, is used to clarify ambiguous experimental data. The S1/T1 preference of the NTII γ-hydrogen abstraction reaction is rationalised by hyperconjugation and allylic resonance stabilisation of the incipient 1,4-biradical intermediate. Multiconfigurational calculations verify an S1/S0 conical intersection along the NTII reaction coordinate. A concerted S0 NTII channel explains recent pentan-2-one data, and is predicted to be accessible in all saturated carbonyls. Similarly, SARs are derived for eight energetically relevant ground state photolysis channels that are mostly absent from atmospheric models. The comprehensive SARs derived in this work are shown to be applicable to a broader set of carbonyl species beyond the datasets used. In case studies of 2-methylbutanal and pinonaldehyde photolysis, where previous analyses have been inconsistent, the photolysis SARs were able to provide consistent mechanisms and explain observed photoproducts.
Design, synthesis and mode of action of short biphenyl and anthranilamide cationic peptidomimetics",2019,"Kuppusamy, Rajesh"
"Antimicrobial resistance is a major worldwide threat to public health and there is an urgent need for the development of novel antibacterial agents. This research project focused on the development of short cationic peptidomimetics that employ 3'-amino-[1, 1 '-biphenyl)-3-carboxylic acid and anthranilic acid backbones segregated by hydrophobic and cationic groups. The biphenyl peptidomimetic compounds showed that simple diaminoethanes and their respective guanidine cationic groups were sufficient to mimic lysine and arginine amino acids of natural antimicrobial peptides. The biphenyl backbone was important for antibacterial activity and tryptophan was important for bacterial cell membrane permeability. The most active compound showed good minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus (15.6 μM) and E.coli (7.8 μM) but was inactive against P. aeruginosa strain PA01. Based on these results, anthranilamide derivatives with tryptophan and simple amine cationic groups were developed. The anthranilamide peptidomimetic compounds showed that the guanidine group was important for good antibacterial activity against S. aureus (3.9 μM), E.coli (15.6 μM), and these compounds had low cytotoxicity (>100 μM). Active compounds disrupted 75% of established S. aureus biofilms. Biphenyl could be used as an alternative to naphthoyl groups to give hydrophobic groups to the mimetics. Increasing the net charge by adding lysine decreased antibacterial activity compared to compounds containing simple amine groups but improved the compound's cytotoxicity.Various alkyl-substituted guanidine compounds were investigated. Increasing the lipophilicity (adding alkyl groups) at the guanidine residues decreased antibacterial activity. Increasing the cationicity increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. The most active compound showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of against S. aureus (2.0 μM), E.coli (7.8 μM), and P. aeruginosa (32.0 μM). The active compounds at 4.0-8.0 μM showed significant disruption (55-77%) of preformed S. aureus biofilms and one compound at 15.6 μM disrupted 45% of E.coli biofilms. Peptidomimetics are promising future antibiotics. These compounds can potentially circumvent current antimicrobial resistance that is generated when bacteria produce biofilms.
Stereoselective fluorination as a conformational tool in a series of structurally related bioactive molecules",2019,"Lizarme Salas, Yuvixza"
"Control molecular conformation via fluorination is a novel strategy for optimising the potency and selectivity of biological target binding. This project investigated selective fluorination strategies to control the conformations of diverse but structurally-related drug candidates. Two are quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor candidates, and the other two are Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug candidates. QS controls several functions including antibiotic resistance, hence disrupting QS systems through inhibitors is a potential strategy for new antimicrobial therapies. In this project, six different fluorinated analogues of each QS inhibitor candidates were synthesised. The fluorination patterns were predicted to control the shape of the analogues to pinpoint the optimal conformation for QS inhibitory (QSI) activity. The conformation of these analogues was investigated, followed by docking studies to predict the best conformation for QSI activity, and finally, QSI activities were tested in bacteria and reveals that the activities of all analogues were improved compared to their respective lead compounds. AD is associated with low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Therefore, drugs that mimic ACh and bind to its receptors are desired to treat AD. An example is xanomeline, which has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce neurodegeneration, however, it has poor selectivity. It was hypothesised that fluorination may deliver a molecule with improved receptor selectivity through conformational control. Therefore, six fluorinated analogues were synthesised. It reveals that these analogues have different conformation. However, the binding affinities of all analogues to all receptor tested were very similar to that of xanomeline. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is another strategy to combat ACh deficit. Piperine has AChE inhibitory activity and possesses a rigid shape due to the presence of double bonds. However, the double bonds can undergo photoisomerisation. It was hypothesised that replacing the double bonds with fluorine atoms may avoid the photoisomerisation problem whilst maintaining inhibitory activity. Therefore, a difluorinated analogue that mimics the rigid shape of piperine was synthesised. It was revealed that this analogue is photostable and inhibitory activity is improved. Overall, this research has contributed to the field of medicinal chemistry by developing a novel strategy for controlling the conformations of four drug candidates.
Fundamentals and Applications of Tandem Mass Spectrometry in Top-down and Bottom-up Protein Analysis",2019,"Wang, Huixin"
"Owing to the development of electrospray ionization (ESI), various ion dissociation techniques and software algorithms, mass spectrometry has become an indispensable tool for protein analysis. However, new approaches are needed to overcome some of the challenges in protein sequencing, including in the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and in the analysis of protein complexes and protein-protein interaction networks. For PTM identification, commonly used database search algorithms for bottom-up proteomics often fail to identify peptides with unexpected PTMs due to their relatively low abundances and the absence of such modifications in the PTM databases. However, such unexpected PTMs can have important roles in biological functions. Here, we report a novel mass spectrometry method to identify the proteins targets of organophosphate (OP) insecticides in a non-targeted fashion. This method integrates a high-resolution twin-ion metabolite extraction program with Mascot database searching. Using this method, transmethylation was identified as a new reaction pathway for OP insecticides, in addition to the well-known phosphorylation modification that causes acute toxicity. Our results show that this method can be used for the reliable identification of unknown PTMs in complicated biomatrices which may ultimately benefit the discovery of protein biomarkers for a variety of conditions. For protein sequence identification, collision induced dissociation (CID) is the most widely used dissociation technique. In the CID of intact proteins, the fragmentation patterns of the protein ion depend strongly on the protein charge state. An optimal charge state can generate selective fragmentation resulting in a limited number of sequence ions in high abundances which can be useful for protein identification with high sensitivity. However, an accurate model to predict the fragmentation patterns of particular charge states is needed. Here, we report an approach to predict the specific cleavage sites of intact protein ions upon CID by use of an improved electrostatic model for calculating the proton configurations of protein ions at different charge states. The origin of highly selective cleavage sites in the CID of highly charged proteins ions is investigated using an improved electrostatic model, molecular dynamics and hybrid ONIOM simulations. The ONIOM results indicate that the protons located at low-basicity amino acid residues can dramatically reduce the reaction barrier to the cleavages at such amide bonds. The results from our electrostatic model suggest that unlike peptide ions at relatively high charge states, protons at low-basicity amino acid residue sites are electrostatically confined within a relatively narrow range of amino acid residues. Such confined protons can 'trigger' the fragmentation at the specific peptide bonds. Our model can potentially be used to predict the specific charge states that yield either specific sequence ions in high abundances, or fragment extensively for optimal protein sequence coverage. Recently, higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) has become available for the LTQ Orbitrap. There are some reports in the literature that demonstrate that HCD benefits the de novo sequencing of proteins and the identification of PTM sites. However, studies investigating the potential use of HCD for intact protein sequencing are relatively rare. Here, we systemically compared the performance of HCD and CID for intact protein analysis. Our results indicate that HCD yields significant performance gains compared to CID for obtaining high sequence coverage at relatively low charge states owing to higher ion trapping efficiencies and higher ion collision energies. The origin of the highly specific cleavages in the HCD of highly charged protein ions was investigated. We found that for HCD, highly specific fragmentation sites occur near the first sites that low-basicity amino acids are predicted to be protonated with increasing charge states, which is consistent with the mechanism for the formation of highly specific fragmentation of protein ions in CID. This result provides additional evidence that the fragmentation patterns of highly charged protein ions can be predicted to improve protein identification. Solution-phase labelling experiments have been increasingly used in combination with top-down proteomics to rapidly obtain structural information. However, the low charge state of protein ions formed from native solutions usually result in low sequence coverage which limits spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate that theta-capillary nanoelectrospray ionization can be used to form protein ions with the highest known charge densities to date from native-like solutions by use of alkyl cyclic carbonate ""supercharging"" additives. It is anticipated this approach will be particularly promising for top-down hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to obtain significantly more protein structural information in native solutions than by use of more conventional approaches.
Investigation of self-assembled block copolymer nanoparticles for drug delivery by small angle scattering techniques",2019,"Cao, Cheng"
"In this thesis, the main objective is to understand the relationship between the physicochemical properties and the biological activities of nanoparticles based on the self-assembled block glycopolymers and the zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorycholine) (MPC) block copolymers. In addition to the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and surface chemistry, drug effects on the nanoparticles' structure and function are investigated. Due to the interaction between the hydrophobic drugs and hydrophilic polymers, hydrophobic drugs might unexpectedly locate in the hydrophilic environment (hydrophilic shell) which can not only induce morphological transitions, but also influence the internal structure of nanoparticles, such as hydration and grafting density. These factors affect the cellular uptake in vitro. Generally, higher hydration of nanoparticles' shells is correlated with an enhanced cellular uptake in MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, and RAW 264.7 cells due to the bioactive group more efficiently contacting to cells in a water environment. Moreover, nanoparticles with higher grafting density polymers suggest a lower cellular uptake due to their increased ability to adsorb protein, and the adsorbed protein not only influences the internal structure change (e.g. thickness of shell and core radius) but also induces an overall shape transition from sphere to oblate. All these factors may lead to lower cellular uptake. Additionally, higher grafting density does not afford an enhanced cellular uptake when the nanoparticles do not adsorb proteins, such as the zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorycholine) (MPC) nanoparticles. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS), with the help of DLS and TEM, play important roles in not only characterizing the size and shape, but also providing information on the internal structure of nanoparticles (e.g. hydration, aggregation number, and grafting density). In this thesis, small angle scattering (SAS) techniques are employed to investigate the relationship between the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and their biological activities for better drug delivery vehicles.
Synthesis and Application of Nicotinamide Phosphine Ligands",2019,"Elton, Timothy"
"Multi-electron reduction of substrates is an ongoing challenge in catalysis, and Organic Hydride Donor (OHO) ligands tethered to metals could unlock new reaction pathways to realise this goal. This Thesis describes the synthesis of bio-inspired ligands containing a phosphine donor substituted by NADH/NAD• mimics. Transition metal complexes containing these ligands were produced, and their reactivity investigated. The prospect of an intermolecular reaction between an OHO and metal-bound formate was explored. Chapter 1 introduces the research. Chapter 2 describes dihydropyridine OHDs as possible reagents for W transfer to the formate ligand of the complex [Fe(dmpe)H(OCHO)], which is produced from CO, insertion to an Fe-H bond. Experiments revealed the hypothesised W transfer does not occur. It was also shown that 1,2-dihydropyridine is unable to transfer H- to CO, in THF. The syntheses of novel phosphine ligands P1-P3 bearing a nicotinamidinium (P1, P3), nicotinamide (P2) and OHO dihydronicotinamide (P1 b) functional group are described in Chapter 3. Ligand P1 could be converted to P1 b using borohydride. The syntheses of gold, rhodium and platinum complexes bearing the ligands P1 and P3 is discussed in Chapter 4. The complexes were incompatible with reducing agents including P1 b and inappropriate as synergistic OHO-metal complexes. The antimicrobial activity of these complexes was investigated, with [AuCl(P3)]CI and its thioglycosylated derivative, [Au(Tl3DGT)(P3)]CI showing modest antimicrobial activity. This activity is likely due to gold present in the structures - ligand P3 may simply serve to transport the gold into the cell. Chapter 5 describes the syntheses of ruthenium p--cymene complexes from P1-P3. [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(P1 b)] was investigated as a H- transfer agent, reducing hexachloroacetone with concomitant production of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(P1 )]. Reactivity studies showed that it is likely the [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(P3b)] is produced by treating [Ru(p-cymene)Cl,(P3)] with HCOONa. Investigation of the anti-carcinogenic activity of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(P3)]CI showed a significant anti-proliferative effect against breast cancer cell lines. Chapter 6 details the synthesis of three (propanedithiolato)diiron carbonyl complexes of ligands P1-P3, and an investigation of possible electrocatalytic activity. Each of the dimers displayed complicated electrochemistry with no useful electrocatalysis observed. Chapter 7 summarises the knowledge gained during this PhD research, and provides suggestions for future progress.
The delivery of organoarsenical anti-cancer agents for the treatment of sarcoma",2019,"Noy, Janina-Miriam"
"This Thesis aims to design and prepare polymeric nanocarriers that are capable of delivering the organoarsenical chemotherapeutic, PENAO (4-(N-(S-penicillaminylacetyl)amino)phenylarsenonous acid) to sarcoma tumors. Polymeric nanoparticles have been widely studied and employed for many metal drugs to improve anti-cancer efficiency as well as overcoming drug related delivery limitations. Although the encapsulation of arsenic trioxide into nano-objects has been extensively studied for decades, there has not been much progress in the delivery of organoarsenical chemotherapeutics, particularly for the treatment of sarcoma. In fact, there are no reports of covalently attaching an organoarsenical drug on a nanoparticle surface that can successfully be delivered to diseased tissue. A hydrophilic drug monomer (PENAO MA) was synthesized, which was readily polymerized in the presence of hydrophilic comonomers via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The copolymers showed negligible cytotoxicities towards sarcoma cells, while upon particle formation, cytotoxic delivery vehicles were obtained. The spherical micelles consisted of poly(methyl methacrylate) (pMMA) and either poly(ethylene glycol) methyl-ether methacrylate-co-PENAO) (p(PEG-co-PENAO)) or poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl-phosphorylcholine-co-PENAO) (p(MPC-co-PENAO), and were formed by utilizing polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). It was also shown that nanoparticle formation could be triggered by amphiphilic p(MMA)-b-p(PEG-co-PENAO) block copolymers upon solvent exchange. PEGylated drug particles can be used as a protein scaffold as no reduced reactivity of the drug was presented, while the zwitterionic MPC drug micelles protected PENAO from unwanted reaction with bovine serum albumin, but also from the conjugation with thiols. This thiol reactivity is indispensable as PENAO's cytotoxicity mainly arises from crosslinking mitochondrial vicinal protein thiols. PENAO's crosslinking ability in a zwitterionic micelle was greater when shorter protein repellent MPC chains were utilized. Small-angle neutron scattering experiments also revealed that the length of p(MPC) influenced drug induced particle formation. The decrease in p(MPC) block lengths resulted in more hydrated nanoparticle shells and elevated biological activity of the delivery vehicles. Multicellular tumor spheroid studies showed that PEGylated drug micelles penetrated deeper into sarcoma tumors and have greater mitochondrial localization than the zwitterionic drug particles, and are therefore more cytotoxic. In conclusion, the presented results of the nanoparticles provide a rationale for further in vivo studies in a sarcoma animal model.
Applications of tropylium ions in organic chemistry",2019,"Lyons, Demelza"
"Cycloheptatrienium (tropylium) is one of three primary members of the non-benzenoid carbocyclic aromatic ion family. Tropylium has a planar cyclic structure with (4n+ 2)π electrons in a fully conjugated system. It fulfils Huckel's rule for aromaticity and hence possess extraordinary stability. Since the historic discovery of tropylium bromide in the late 19th century, these non-benzenoid aromatic ions have attracted a lot of attention because of their unique combination of stability and reactivity. This thesis has six chapters in total that attempt to delve deeper into understanding what the tropylium ion is capable of, and has two main themes: (i) using the tropylium ion and related species as catalysts for the promotion of synthetic reactions and (ii) incorporating the tropylium moiety as a building block into new structural motifs for the development of advanced functional materials. The first Chapter is a literature review that highlights the recent developments in utilising nonbenzenoid aromatic ions for the promotion of organic reactions and discusses the potential of aromatic ions in promoting synthetically useful organic transformations. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate for the first time that tropylium salts can act as organic Lewis acid catalysts to facilitate acetalization and transacetalization reactions of a wide range of aldehyde substrates. Chapter 3 is the exploration of acyl transfer reactions utilising tropolone salt, a tropyliumrelated species, as a catalyst. Chapter 4 explores the chemical versatility and unique structural properties of the tropylium ion to derive a family of novel push–pull organic dyes. Chapter 5 focuses on the development of a conceptually new method for the formation of biaryl motifs, which was carried out through the oxidative ring contraction of the tropylium ion with mild oxidants.
Gold-Palladium Bimetallic Nanocrystals for Improved Methanol and Ethanol Oxidation Reaction Electrocatalysis",2019,"Kelly, Cameron"
"This thesis aims to understand of the role of the secondary metal for improvement of alkaline methanol and ethanol oxidation reaction electrocatalysis using different morphologies of Au-Pd and Ag-Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts. The Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) is a fuel cell technology capable of generating energy through the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the reaction that occurs at the anode, is of research interest to produce renewable energy. This process relies on precious metal catalysts to efficiently produce energy, namely nanoscale Pt-Ru. Current fuel cell technology is therefore expensive and unsuitable for large-scale implementation. Palladium can act as an electrocatalyst for the process in the same way as platinum, but in its monometallic form suffers from high overpotentials and significant poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO) generated in situ. Previous research has shown improved activity of palladium in alkaline electrolytes which, while unsuitable for platinum, are known to improve alcohol oxidation reaction kinetics through preferred oxidation of methanol to formate. The addition of a secondary metal assists in both modulation of palladium-reactant binding strengths and co-catalysed oxidation of CO when exposed at the surface. Chapter one reviews the literature on the DMFC and anode electrocatalysts. The current platinum catalysts and foundation knowledge of the mechanism on platinum are compared to current palladium catalysts. The requirements for new nanoscale palladium catalysts and background on their synthesis are outlined. Chapter two details the methods used for characterisation of nanocrystals produced in this thesis. Chapter three validates a modified synthetic method for Au-Pd core shell and develops new syntheses for Ag-Pd core-shell and Au-Pd alloy nanocrystals. Chapter four assesses the activity of Au-Pd core-shell and alloy nanocrystals for MOR electrocatalysis and finds that gold, both at the surface and inside the core, enhances activity and stability. Chapter five correlates increasing electrocatalytic properties with decreasing shell thickness, originating from electron-withdrawing effects of gold on palladium. Chapter six adapts the ideas from MOR and analyses the catalytic activity of Au-Pd bimetallic nanocrystals for the Ethanol Oxidation Reaction (EOR). Chapter seven draws overall conclusions from the thesis
Transition metal and lanthanide chemistry of dipyridylpyrrolide ligands",2019,"McPherson, James"
"Pincer ligands attract great current interest because they bestow exceptional stability on their metal complexes. Modification of the pincer scaffold can be used to tune the electron density at the metal ion and, therefore, the physical and chemical properties. This thesis reports studies of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)pyrrolide (dpp–) NNN-pincer ligands and their transition and rare-earth metal complexes. Homoleptic complexes were prepared and screened for useful physical (e.g., magnetic or photophysical) or chemical (e.g., redox or reactive) properties. Predictable control of the properties through the substitution of the pyrrolide ring was a particular goal, and was achieved. The critical review of the literature on the chemistry of dpp– ligands and related pyridine-pyrrolide pincers, Chapter 1, concluded that a range of dpp– derivatives with flexible coordination modes was accessible, but with underdeveloped coordination chemistry. Chapter 2 provides a theoretical quantification (B3LYP-GD3BJ/6-31G** calculations) of the internal stain (ΔEL(strain)) that builds when a dpp– or related pyridine-pyrrolide pincer ligand binds a metal ion. A relationship was discovered correlating ΔEL(strain) and the change in interatomic separation of the two terminal donor atoms when bound (ρL(coord)) and metal-free (ρL(relax)). The relationship was employed to explain, a posteriori, the occurrence of spin crossover activity in Fe(II)-pincer complexes. A series of five structurally similar cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(dppR1,R2)2], bearing different pyrrolide 3,4-substituents are discussed in Chapter 3. The oxidation and spin states of the cobalt ion were switched by appropriate external stimuli, with the CoIII/CoII couple predictably sensitive to the Swain-Lupton electronic parameters for the pyrrolide substituents. Chapter 4 describes the first lanthanide(III) complexes of dpp– ligands. Ligand-sensitised, lanthanide-centred emission was observed for [Eu(dppCO2Me,Me)3] (red emission) and [Yb(dppCO2Me,Me)3] (near-infrared emission). Chapter 5 reports enhanced reactivity for [Ru(dpp)2] complexes compared to the ubiquitous [Ru(tpy)2]2+. Hemilability of the dpp– ligand results from its large ρL(relax), and this was exploited for catalytic transformations of small molecules bound at the ruthenium(II) centre. Four small preliminary studies are included in Chapter 6, each providing an entry point into more detailed future investigations. Chapter 7 provides a summary of the results, highlights advances made and suggests how these could be used into the future.
Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel nitrogen heterocycles as therapeutic agents.",2019,"Dobrowolski, Jeremy"
"This PhD thesis describes the discovery of synthetic strategies to target novel heterocycles and fused ring systems. The primary aim of the research was to develop novel heterocycles as analogous systems to the antimalarial natural product dependensin as well as to explore the chemistry of these previously unreported classes of compounds. The secondary aim of this PhD project was to explore the chemistry and develop efficient synthetic routes to novel fused heterocyclic systems containing the benzazepine moiety. Previously, extensive research had been conducted on new antimalarial compounds, focusing on the flavonoid systems closely related to dependensin. However, analogous systems in which the heterocyclic oxygen atoms of dependensin are replaced by other heterocyclic atoms, generating the 5,6- dihydrodibenzo[b,h][1,6]naphthyridine, chromeno[4,3-b]quinoline and thiochromeno[4,3-b]quinoline derivatives, had been relatively unexplored. This thesis describes the efficient synthesis of a range of dihydrodibenzo[b,h][1,6]naphthyridine, chromeno[4,3-b]quinoline thiochromeno[4,3-b]quinoline derivatives using an inexpensive and versatile Friedlaender coupling methodology which allows for the generation of diverse analogues, related to the dependensin natural product. Additionally, a robust and simple synthetic pathway was developed to access novel fused heterocyclic ring systems via an initial addition-oxidation-ring cleavage cascade reaction under basic conditions in the presence of NaOH in DMSO to give a versatile 1,4-diketone intermediate. Subsequent cyclisation reactions gave the azepine moiety fused with either quinoline or indole ring systems with high levels of substitution possible. The synthesis of two novel classes of heterocycles, namely the dihydrobenzo[6,7]azepino[3,2-c]quinolinones and 11-phenylbenzo[6,7]azepino[3,2- b]indolones was achieved. This work considerably expands the number of examples of structures incorporating the dihydrobenzazepine scaffold. The range and diversity of the developed fused heterocyclic systems have resulted in four publications to date.
Solid-state nanopore blockade sensors: from fabrication to localized surface functionalization to sensing application",2018,"Wu, Yanfang"
"New technologies are revolutionizing disease diagnostics. Sensitive determination of disease related biomarkers to which single molecule detection is the ultimate goal, will help doctors to make precise decision and effective treatment on time which is of significant importance to patience's wellbeing. Recently nanopore-based sensors emerge rapidly as one promising technology in biophysical and bio-analytical studies due to single entity sensitivity and label-free manner. However, so far the main research has been focusing on works at single-pore sensors. The other concern is that it is challenging to quantify target analytes in ultra-low concentrations as it takes time for rare copies of molecules to find and pass through a nanopore that is governed by Brownian motion and electrophoresis. In addition to this, it is still an unsolved issue to achieve single molecule resolution when applying devices of multipores to biosensing studies based on electric signals. This dissertation presents the development of implementation of biosensing devices based on solid-state chips with nanopore arrays for single-molecule detection of proteins. Chapter 1 provides a perspective review over the recent developments of ultrasensitive bioanalytical sensors and the challenges this class of biosensor faces when moving to single molecule quantitative sensors. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the field of nanopore and nanopore-based biosensing applications. Recent advances in bio-analytical applications are reviewed followed with a summary about the scientific questions to be addressed in this dissertation. Chapter 3 documents the information for chemicals, materials, instrumentations, operational conditions and procedures that have been employed in the following chapters. In relating to the above mentioned questions, Chapter 4 describes the work about deploying a novel sensing paradigm called ""Nanopore Blockade Sensors"" for single-molecule detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) demonstrated here as a model protein analyte. Rare copies of PSA molecules have been detected in buffered solutions and blood samples at chips of 3 × 3 nanopore array, showing comparable performance to that from a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. It is demonstrated that the developed sensors are capable of directly detecting PSA from human whole blood, indicating the potential to sense PSA in complex matrix without pre-treatment process. Also studies with nanopore based sensors demand the capability to differentiate chemical functionalities at nanopore inside and outside areas and potentially conduct systematic investigation about contributions from these two surface areas. Therefore, Chapter 5 introduces a material-specific modification strategy and is demonstrated first at microsized planar surfaces. After successful demonstration at planar interfaces, Chapter 6 presents the work about fabrication and sensing performance of devices with gold metallized nanopore arrays. This is the first ever investigation of fabrication of metallic nanopore array where the metal coating is spatially deposited onto nanopore interior walls only and this work sheds light on research into sophisticated fabrication and further optical studies with the fabricated solid-state metallic nanopores. Chapter 7 summarizes the work of this dissertation and provides a viewing about the future prospects with solid-state devices of (metallic) nanopore arrays as sensors in bio-analytical and biomedical applications.
Synthesis of Novel Fused-Ring Flavonoid Systems and Their Anticancer Activity",2018,"Nuraini, Vidia Afina"
"This project aimed to synthesize fused-ring systems derived from flavanones and isoflavanones by utilizing the chemistry of the highly reactive ortho-quinone methide (o-QM) intermediate. The synthesis of cis-4-arylisoflavan and isoflavene derivatives was also explored by employing different metal catalysts. The fused-ring systems were synthesized via inverse electron-demand Diels Alder (iEDDA) reaction between dienophiles and o-QM intermediate, which was generated in situ by thermolysis of the corresponding Mannich base. The reaction proceeded in a highly regioselective way, which can be explained by the charge distribution of the reacting partners. However, in the case of 7-hydroxyflavanone, the cycloadduct mixture contained both ring-closed flavanone product and ring-opened chalcone product. The iEDDA reactions were found to give cycloadducts in high yields when electron-rich alkenes were used. In contrast, electron-poor dienophiles remained unreactive in this reaction. The chemistry of o-QM was further studied using dihydrodaidzein, an isoflavanone-type compound as a scaffold. The ability of o-QM to undergo both [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with dienophiles and Michael addition with nucleophiles was explored. However, under certain conditions, the isoflavanone core underwent ring-opening, a process which was proposed to involve the formation of a propenone intermediate. Electron-rich arenes such as 3,5-dimethoxyphenol and 3,5-dimethoxyaniline participated in a Michael addition reaction to furnish the biarylmethane analogues, possessing a methylene bridge which connected the C8 of dihydrodaidzein with the arene moiety. Interestingly, with sulfur-containing arenes, the resulting products possessed a thioether linkage. A rationale for this observation has been proposed. 4-Arylisoflavans and isoflavenes were reported to exhibit promising anticancer activities. The synthesis of these derivatives was explored by utilizing metal catalysts. cis-4-Arylisoflavans were prepared in moderate to good yields by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding 4-arylisoflavenes. Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions between the key intermediate 3-iodo-4-phenyl-2H-chromene and various phenylboronic acids or heterocyclic boronic acids allowed the generation of 4-arylisoflavene analogues. A gold(I) catalyst was also successfully used in preparing isoflavenes without a phenyl ring at the C4 position. The anticancer activity of the isoflavan and isoflavene analogues was investigated. The results paved the way for some structural modifications in order to generate more active analogues.
Digital analysis of single plasmonic nanoparticles for ultrasensitive biosensing",2018,"Sriram, Manish"
"Abstract: A major hurdle in the development of next-generation biosensors is the ability detect single molecules and the use of this detection to form an appropriate assessment of the larger biological system. Once, this has been achieved, it will be possible to build new and more efficient biosensors that can detect subtle concentration changes in early disease stages and, biosensors that no longer require calibration. The unique optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles offer the possibility to develop single nanoparticle assays that are capable of these ultra-low detection limits. Current spectroscopic techniques can sensitively analyse spectral shifts of these nanoparticles; however, these nanoparticles need to be analysed in a high-throughput manner to obtain a useful assessment of a biological system. This main objective of this thesis was to develop a technique for the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of plasmonic nanoparticles, and the construction of a biosensing interface capable of ultra-sensitive detection. The first stage in this goal was achieved by developing a technique for high-throughput single nanoparticle analysis. The technique utilises a consumer-grade camera and a dark-field microscope to analyse the λmax of several thousands of nanoparticles within a second, without the need for a spectrometer. The development of this digital analysis technique enabled single nanoparticle assays to be performed rapidly. However, to detect at very low concentrations it is necessary to employ a signal enhancement step. Within this work, two signal amplification and detection strategies were explored: i) enzyme-catalysed nanoparticle growth and ii) core-satellite formation for multiplexed detection of DNA. The enzyme-catalysed system was able to grow the nanoparticles and cause a change in LSPR. However, for integration into single nanoparticle assays the enzyme-based amplification strategy needs to be optimised to minimise the background signal. A second amplification technique based on plasmon coupling was fabricated and used to construct a single nanoparticle assay. This single-satellite nanosensor was used to demonstrate the ability to count single DNA. Finally, DNA-directed core-satellite formation was used with the digital analysis technique to show the ability to perform multiplexed single nanoparticle assays in-parallel.
Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel glyoxamide based antibacterial agents",2018,"Nizalapur, Shashidhar"
"Antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the ability of bacteria to transfer genes encoding resistant mechanisms. Thereby, conventional antibiotics are becoming ineffective against various microorganisms including bacteria. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of antibacterial agents with novel therapeutic actions. Bacteria cooperatively regulate the expression of many phenotypes such as biofilm formation and virulence factor expression through a mechanism called quorum sensing (QS). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a key component of the mammalian defense system that provides protection against various pathogens. Thus, the development of novel quorum-sensing inhibitors and AMP mimics are viable strategies to counteract the increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance. The current research work focussed on the design and synthesis of novel acyclic and cyclic glyoxamide derivatives via the ring-opening reactions of N-arylisatins and N-acylisatins with amines and amino acid esters. These compounds were investigated for quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MH602 and Escherichia coli MT102. The most active compound inhibited GFP fluorescence production by 48.7% in P. aeruginosa MH602 and 73.6% in E. coli MT102, at 250 μM, respectively. Also, pyocyanin and biofilm inhibition activities of these glyoxamide compounds were determined in P. aeruginosa and E. coli, and these compounds possessed greatest pyocyanin inhibition activity with 47% inhibition against P. aeruginosa and significant biofilm inhibition (40-71%) against P. aeruginosa and E. coli, at 250 μM, respectively. In addition, various glyoxamide based AMP mimics derived from the ring-opening reactions of N-naphthoylisatin have also been reported in this work. The antibacterial activity of these glyoxamide derivatives was investigated against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli by their zoneof- inhibition and the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The most active compounds exhibited greatest MIC values with 6 μg/mL and 17 μg/mL against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. Furthermore, these compounds showed significant biofilm inhibition (40-65%) and disruption (40-72%) activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the in vitro toxicity of these compounds against human lung fibroblast cells revealed that these compounds are less toxic to human cells.
Synthesis of novel flavonoid hybrids and development of their delivery systems",2017,"Yee, Ming Han Eugene"
"The primary aim of this project is to develop novel anti-tumor agents based on the scaffolds of two natural flavonoids phenoxodiol and (+)-catechin, and evaluate their biological properties and mechanism of action in cancer cells. The phenoxodiol scaffold was structurally modified through molecular hybridization and addition of fused-ring systems. Phenoxodiol was combined with 1-amino-2-propanol and thiosemicarbazone moieties to generate novel phenoxodiol-hybrids. The 1-amino-2-propanol and thiosemicarbazone moieties were linked with phenoxodiol through nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide intermediate, and through Schiff base condensation with an aldehyde or ketone intermediate. Synthesis of fused hybrid systems was carried out via an inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction between electron-rich dienophiles and ortho-quinone methide intermediate of phenoxodiol. In order to overcome the poor bioavailability of flavonoids, which limits their clinical use, different drug delivery vehicles for phenoxodiol and (+)-catechin were explored. Carbohydrates, β-cyclodextrin and dextran, were selected for their aqueous solubility and biocompatibility. Phenoxodiol was encapsulated into β-cyclodextrin via a modified co-evaporation method, and was alternatively conjugated onto dextran using an enzymatic method. (+)-Catechin was conjugated onto β-cyclodextrin via a cycloaddition strategy. In vitro anti-proliferative activities of the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated against various cancer cell types. In general, most of the compounds exhibited strong anti-proliferative activities across all the tested cancer cell lines. Importantly, many of them also showed an overall increase in specificity as compared to the parent molecule. As angiogenesis plays an important role in cancer progression, the anti-angiogenic mechanism for dextran-catechin conjugate was investigated and demonstrated that it inhibited angiogenesis by disrupting copper metabolism within the endothelial cells. The conjugate was shown to generate reactive oxygen species that lead to reduction of ATOX-1 protein, which protects the cells from oxidative stress. ATOX-1 is also responsible for the transport of copper within the cell and to the VEGF promoter, which is required for angiogenesis. This study shows that structural modification and the employment of carbohydrate-based drug delivery vehicles can be an effective strategy to enhance the overall anti-tumor activity of flavonoids.
Novel Antibacterial Biomaterials and Polymers Based on Quorum Sensing Inhibitors",2017,"Taunk, Aditi"
"Bacterial biofilms on life-saving implanted medical devices are a serious problem in long-term. At present, no effective strategies are available and the emergence of multi-drug resistance has highlighted the need to develop novel antibacterial coatings to combat device-related infections. One approach is to block the bacterial communication pathway or quorum sensing (QS), which is responsible for biofilm formation, by incorporating QS inhibitors (QSIs) such as dihydropyrrolones (DHPs) and furanones (FUs) on biomaterial surfaces and polymers. The endogenous biological signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) is also a potential candidate for prevention of biomedical infections due to its antibiofilm activity. In this study, DHPs and brominated FUs were immobilized on surfaces via a non-specific nitrene-insertion method. The successful covalent attachment of compounds was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The coated surfaces showed excellent in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, DHP surfaces at low concentrations (0.17–0.35 % halogen) were found to display similar levels of activity as FUs with higher surface attachment (0.41–0.74 % Br), which was possibly due to change in orientation of DHP during attachment. The influence of DHP orientation and absence of an exocyclic double bond on the biological activity was then examined by specific covalent attachment using EDC/NHS coupling. The orientation of DHP with free lactam ring exposed to bacterial medium showed higher activity compared to DHPs attached from the nitrogen of the lactam ring. In addition, DHPs lacking the exocyclic double bond were also able to reduce bacterial adhesion without killing both strains of bacteria, indicating DHPs retained their activity even in absence of the exocyclic bond. This project also focused on developing dual-action surfaces and polymers that were functionalized by DHPs via Michael-addition reaction and diazeniumdiolates (NO donors) derived from the reaction of secondary amines with NO gas. The DHP+NO surfaces demonstrated significantly higher efficacy in reducing colonization of both bacterial strains than the DHP coatings alone, while the hybrid polymer displayed excellent activity by inhibiting 95 % of P. aeruginosa biofilm at all concentrations (42–1 µM) via a non-toxic mechanism. Therefore, the coatings based on QSIs show great potential in reducing device-related infections.
Toward the Realisation of a User-Intervention-Free, Point-of-Care, Diagnostics Platform",2017,"Ginges, Joshua"
"Point-of-care diagnostics is a field that has attracted much attention in the past few decades -- however realising the dream of a small, portable, user-intervention free, and rapid diagnostic device for the detection of small, organic analytes, remains elusive. To date, optical and electrochemical methods have not been able to satisfy all of the criteria necessary to build such a device, with the main challenge being able to overcome background noise due to non-specific events when attempting to transduce the signal for a particular analyte. In attempting to solve this problem, Blocked Electrochemical Sensing Technology (BEST) has a redox-active reporter molecule that is dispersed on the electrode surface amongst an anti-fouling diluent. The main advantage of the design is that signal is proportional only to the degree to which binding of the analyte occurs around the reporting molecule (facilitated by an epitope in proximity to it), and not on the electrode surface in general. Of course, non-specific adsorption can still contribute to background signal, but the chance of this occurring is minimised for this design. Although BEST has been shown to work with various analytes, its current configuration is not suitable for commercialisation. The interface makes use of a difficult to synthesise, and unstable, molecular wire, which is necessary to facilitate electron transfer between the electrode surface and the redox reporting molecule, through the passivating oligo(ethylene glycol)-based anti-fouling layer. Zwitterionic molecules have shown great promise as an alternative to oxidation-prone oligo(ethylene glycol)-based antifouling molecules, however to date they have been attached to surfaces via long alkane tails, or have been polymer-based; either way, they passivate the surfaces to which they are attached. In this work, a range of small, non-passivating, zwitterionic molecules are examined for their antifouling ability, with the aim of simplifying the BEST design by replacing the passivating antifouling layer with one that is non-passivating, thus obviating the need for a molecular wire. Phosphorylcholineethanethiol is identified as a suitable candidate, shown to possess antifouling qualities similar to oligo(ethylene glycol)-based coatings, and to be non-passivating when attached to a gold electrode.
New Heterocyclic Structures derived from Activated Indoles and Related Heterocycles",2017,"Jiang, Hao"
"The project investigated two aspects of novel structures containing indoles, benzimidazoles, and benzothiazoles. One focus was the synthesis of compounds with improved antimicrobial properties. The other focus was on the synthesis of new biheterocyclic structures and their potential conversion into novel porphyrin-like macrocycles. Novel indole-based inhibitors of bacterial RNA holoenzyme formation were investigated. The Knoevenagel condensation was found to be a convenient method for the synthesis of novel inhibitors which incorporate 2-phenyl benzimidazole, 2-phenylbenzothiazole, or 4,6-dimethoxyindole-2-carboxylate scaffolds with rhodanine analogues. The synthesised compounds have been tested for their ability to inhibit RNA polymerase – σA interactions using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were also investigated. The structure-activity relationship studies of synthesised compounds revealed that biological activities were affected by the C2 modifications of the indole. The 2-thiobarbituric acid moiety was found to be necessary for the antibacterial activity and several of these novel inhibitors showed significant antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis at micromolar concentration. One indole-2-carboxylate -2-thiobarbituric acid hybrid was recognized as a lead compound for further investigation. IV Four different 2,7'indolylheteroaromatic systems were investigated, including 2,7'indolylbenzimidazole, 2,7'indolylbenzothiazole, 2,7'indolylbenzoxazole and 2,7'indolylbenzofuran. Specially activated examples of 2,7'indolylbenzimidazoles and 2,7'indolylbenzofurans were prepared from 4,6-dimethoxyindoles, and their reactivity was investigated. The 2,7'indolylbenzimidazoles were shown to form 2:1 complexes with zinc, copper, and nickel. The ML2 structures were confirmed by NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry data. Numerous attempts were made to convert the biheterocyclic systems into porphyrin-like macrocycles by oxidative coupling reactions. However, these were largely unsuccessful due to the relative unreactivity of the benzimidazole ring component. One centro-symmetric macrocycle containing a 2,7'indolylbenzimidazole component was synthesised via an acid-catalysed addition reaction of a mono hydroxymethyl substituted biheterocycle, which was derived from the corresponding aldehyde by reduction. The macrocycle synthesis derived from bis(hydroxymethyl) indolylbenzimidazole was attempted under the same synthetic strategy, but the desired macrocycle could not be isolated. The synthesis of porphyrin-like macrocycles containing two benzimidazoles and two benzothiazoles via 2-7'links using an aldehyde-amine condensation approach was investigated. Different protection and deprotection methods were systematically screened to synthesise an appropriately substituted 2-(7' V benzimidazolyl)benzthiazole. A 4,6-dimethoxy-2-(2',3'diaminophenyl)benzthiaz-ole was successfully synthesised and converted into a benzimidazolone derivative. However, initial attempts to dimerize this derivative into a porphyrin-like macrocycle were unsuccessful.
Synthesis of chromene based natural products",2016,"Hong, Kam"
"The primary aim of this project was to develop total syntheses of natural products kamalachalcone A and rottlerin, as their syntheses have never been reported. These two targets are structurally related, and thus the complete syntheses of these molecules would help explain their biosynthesis and key bond formations in nature. Novel chromene analogues with fused ring systems were synthesized by developing a method to generate ortho-quinone methide precursors, which could be reacted with various electron-rich alkenes to form fused heterocyclic rings. The results showed that electron-rich alkenes such as vinyl ether and styrene derivatives favour the cycloaddition reaction whereas electron poor alkenes do not undergo this reaction. The results also showed that electron-rich arenes could also furnish biarylmethane compounds, a potential strategy towards the synthesis of rottlerin. To explore the properties of ortho-quinone methides further, novel fluorinated dependensin analogues were synthesized by the FeCl3-catalyzed dimerization reaction of the corresponding fluorinated flavenes. The results suggested that the dimerization reaction of flavenes is controlled electronically, with electronegative fluorine substituents appearing to deactivate the overall nucelophilicity of flavenes, thus leading to lower yields of the dimeric products. Dimerization reactions were only successful with flavene scaffolds containing two or fewer fluorine substituents. By understanding the properties of ortho-quinone methides, kamalachalcone A was synthesized for the first time via the acid-catalyzed dimerization of red compound. The use of FeCl3 offered the best yield with short reaction time. The structurally similar compound, rottlerin, was synthesized by reacting 5-hydroxychromene with Eschenmoser's salt to provide N,N-dimethylaminomethyl chromene as an ortho-quinone methide precursor, which upon heating with acetophenone, provided rottlerin. By understanding the formation of the side product rottlerone during the deprotection of MOM-protected chromene, the overall synthesis was re-designed and a new five-step gram scale synthesis of rottlerin was developed. Upon keeping rottlerin in DMSO, the chalcone moiety of rottlerin underwent cyclization leading to the formation of another natural product called isorottlerin, and this is the first report of the ability of rottlerin to undergo such a change.
N-Glyoxylamides as versatile precursors for peptide mimics and heterocycles",2015,"Le, Duc"
"The work presented in this thesis aims to highlight the versatile reactions of N-acylisatins as precursors for the synthesis of novel peptide mimics and heterocycles. N-arylisatins were prepared via Chan-Lam coupling of various electron-deficient arylboronic acids with isatin. Attempts to ring-open these N-arylisatins with primary alcohols were unsuccessful. However, when subjected to tert-butylamine in refluxing conditions, the corresponding N-glyoxylacid salts were obtained along with the N-glyoxylamides as minor products. A novel series of first generation amphiphilic peptide mimics were prepared from the ring-opening reactions of hydrophobic N-acylisatins by various amines. Further modification allowed for the introduction of cationic moieties such as those mimicking positively charged amino acids as well as tertiary ammonium groups. An extension of this chemistry was used to prepare a series of second generation peptide mimics from terephthaloyl chloride. By altering the core structure of these compounds the balance of charge and hydrophobicity could be controlled. The N-acylisatin ring-opening strategy was applied to the synthesis of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTA) allowing access to both novel BTA-N-glyoxylesters and amides with peripheral alkyl chains. Furthermore BTA-N-glyoxylamides with peripheral amino acid esters were prepared in a similar fashion demonstrating the ease with which BTAs can be functionalized using this strategy. Various N-protected amino acids were coupled to isatin forming N-amino acyl isatins. These novel N-acylisatins participate in ring-opening reaction with either alcohols or amines to give the corresponding N-glyoxylesters or amides. Upon deprotection these precursors cyclize to form1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones bearing C5 pendant amide or ester groups. This is a novel synthetic strategy that provides access to these biologically relevant molecules from cheap and readily accessible starting materials. A number of strategies were investigated for the design and synthesis of novel cyclic peptide mimics incorporating the N-glyoxylamide moiety. Macrocyclization via ring closing metathesis (RCM) and macrolactonization were attempted with little success. Macrolactamization of aN-glyoxylmethylester containing a β-alanine moiety 6-26 afforded the first cyclic dimer containing two N-glyoxylamide units.
Defining Protocols for the Synthesis of 3-Substituted-5-benzylideneimidazolidine-2,4-diones",2015,"Hidayat, Ika-Wiani"
"This thesis describes a detailed examination of parameters that control formation of substituted benzalhydantoins in a multistep process from aldehydes and 3-un/substituted hydantoins following modifications of the Wheeler and Hoffman process. The purpose of the study was to develop optimal reaction conditions for a planned, automated parallel synthesis of indoles, with the benzalhydantoins as intermediates. An initial comparative study, based on preparative yields, of the synthesis of benzalhydantoins from the condensation of substituted aldehydes and unsubstituted and 3-substituted hydantoins under the established Wheeler and Hoffman procedure was found imprecise. Consequently, an LC-MS analytical method was developed for reaction monitoring. Investigation of the roles of temperature, reaction time, and aldehyde and hydantoin substituents showed dependence on the latter two features and revealed formation of benzylhydantoin alcohols. The process of 3-allylation of benzalhydantoins was investigated as a model for the final step in an alternative preparation of 3-alkylbenzalhydantoins. Overall, an excess of reagent allyl chloride played an important role in optimizing yields, however yields were limited. A microwave-irradiation method gave more rapid conversions and allowed better comparison of reaction rates. A parallel investigation of the scope of tandem allylation-condensation reactions, which indicated that the alkylation of hydantoin and the condensation of aldehydes with hydantoin occurred simultaneously, was described. 3-Unsubstituted benzalhydantoins were obtained as major products, even after prolonged reaction times, suggesting that condensation of aldehydes with 3-substituted hydantoins was slower than with hydantoin itself. A systematic study of the effect of microwave acceleration on the initial condensation was described, and the revealed benzylhydantoin alcohols were found as major products, rather than benzalhydantoins. The alcohols were studied in one example in the solid state by single crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis and found to form as two racemic diastereoisomers that crystallized together in racemic pairs. Twenty-three synthetic (thio)hydantoins and benzalhydantoins were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Malassezia furfur, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, by the paper disc diffusion method. 3-Allyl-4'-nitro- and 3-n-butyl-2'-bromo-4',5'-dimethoxybenzalhydantoin showed the most promise as drug leads. Five representative benzalhydantoins examined by x-ray crystallography showed disparate behaviour that could not be related to molecular structure nor physicochemical or biological properties.
Novel small molecules for modulation of bacterial signaling pathways",2015,"Biswas, Nripendra"
"Conventional treatments for bacterial infections target bacterial viability, an approach that exerts a strong selective survival pressure on bacteria, leading to the development of multidrug resistant mutants. The number of multidrug resistant strains is increasing exponentially, far outpacing the development of new antibiotics. The conventional antibiotics are no longer the magic bullets they were once thought to be and there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics and/or novel strategies that do not induce bacterial resistance. Bacteria employ a population-dependent cell-to-cell communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) to express various pathogenic traits such as virulence factor production and biofilm formation. Therefore, QS inhibition is a promising novel strategy to selectively control multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, without exerting evolutionary pressures and development of resistance. This project focused on the design and synthesis of novel QS inhibitors based on common QS signaling molecules, such as N-acylated L-homoserine lactones (AHLs), indoles, N-acetyl glucosamine and other heterocyclic systems derived from halogenated furanones (Fimbrolides). Indole and glucosamine-based amides and oxo-amides were synthesized as non-native AHL mimics by applying EDC, DCC or EDC/HOBt mediated amide coupling methods. On docking study, the indole-based AHL mimics showed strong binding affinity with P. aeruginosa LasR receptor, with compound 146d having highest docking scores of 61.58. The reactions of brominated furanones with hydrazines have been developed granting access to 5-membered aminopyrrolones and hydrazinyl furanones, as well as 6-membered pyridazinones with novel bromination patterns. The ratio of formation of these different heterocycles varied with the types of hydrazine, as well as with the numbers of equivalents of hydrazines used. The X-ray crystallography analysis, revealed the characteristic halogen bonding in addition to other interactions such as hydrogen bonding which might facilitate efficient binding to the bacterial QS receptor proteins (LasR). The alkyne analogues of fimbrolides were synthesized via Sonogashira coupling reactions where the reaction was favored at the C5 bromo methylene group over the C4 bromine substituent of fimbrolides. Applying the Suzuki coupling reaction, various mono and di-aryl substituted fimbrolide analogues were synthesized where the aryl substitution also favored at the C5 bromo methylene group over the C4 bromo substituent. The dimeric scaffolds of fimbrolides were synthesized as novel ring structures using diboronic acids. Two different types of monoamino substituted (4-bromo or 5-bromomethylene) fimbrolides were isolated as novel structures via Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reactions of fimbrolides with various secondary amines from a single reaction in a predictable fashion (2:1 regioisomeric ratio). The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their QS inhibitory (QSI) efficacy against the P. aeruginosa PAMH602 and E. coli MT102 strains in terms of inhibition of their green fluorescent protein (GFP) production i.e. QS inhibition. The alkyne based fimbrolides compounds exhibited the highest QSI (up to 97.6% QSI at 250 µM) effect against P. aeruginosa MH602 followed by glucosamine (up to QSI 79.1% and 97.5% at 2 mM concentration against P. aeruginosa MH602 and E. coli MT102 strain respectively) and the indole based AHL analogues (up to 65% QSI at 250 µM against P. aeruginosa MH602). The co-treatment of some potent QS inhibitory compounds with tobramycin also showed two-three fold enhanced P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibitory effect compared to single tobramycin treatment. These findings highlight the potential usefulness of synthesized compounds in this project with non-violent modes of action i.e. blocking bacterial communication, a key strategy for the development of future anti-QS antimicrobial compounds.
Novel retinoid enhancers for anti-cancer therapies",2015,"Gardner, Christopher"
"Retinoids play a crucial role in the treatment of multiple human cancers, particularly neuroblastoma and leukaemia. However, their utility is often hampered by the inherent toxicities associated with the concentrations necessary for therapeutic benefit, as well as innate or acquired resistance to treatment. This thesis focuses on the discovery and development of novel scaffolds that possess cytotoxic activity mediated through the retinoid pathways. A protocol for docking scaffolds into the binding site of the retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) was developed. These docking methodologies were used to identify novel scaffolds as potential RARβ ligands, as well as probe the mechanisms behind the observed structure activity relationships (SAR) of the prepared compounds. A wide range of novel indole-benzothiazole acetamides were synthesized via PyBOP amide coupling of 3-indoleacetic acids and 2-aminobenzothiazoles. These scaffolds were investigated for their cytotoxic activity against neuroblastoma cells. Several analogues were found to have low micromolar IC50 values, demonstrated selectivity towards cells with high RARβ expression and also were selective for cancerous cells over normal cells. Furthermore, the ability of these compounds to modulate RAR protein expression was demonstrated. Indole and quinoline-oxadiazoles were synthesized by the dehydrocyclization of bis-hydrazides by 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride. The cytotoxic activity of these scaffolds was investigated with their selectivity towards cells overexpressing different RAR subtypes (α, β, γ) also investigated. Benzothiazole-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole amides were also synthesized by the one-pot, single step alkylation-aldol condensation of methyl thioglycolate and formyl-halopyrazoles. The cytotoxicity and SAR of these scaffolds was also explored.
Indoles as Novel Antibacterial Agents and Versatile Precursors of Complex Heterocyclic Structures",2015,"Mielczarek, Marcin"
"The undertaken research has been realized in two fundamental areas: indoles as novel antibacterial agents and versatile precursors of complex heterocyclic structures. Several classes of structurally related hydrazine-linked bis-indoles were synthesized and evaluated towards inhibition of bacterial transcription initiation complex formation. The compounds were found to efficiently inhibit the β'-σ70/σA interaction essential for RNA polymerase holoenzyme formation as well as the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were carried out in order to identify the structural features of the synthesized inhibitors potentially required for biological activity. Structurally related scaffolds were explored as well. Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of a variety of mono-indole-, mono-benzofuran-, bis-indolylmethane- and tetra-indole-based carbox- and glyoxyloylamides, and carbo- and glyoxyloylhydrazides demonstrated that significant reduction in molecule size resulted in not only solubility enhancement, but also in retention of biological activity both at the level of inhibition of the β′-σ70/σA interaction and bacterial growth in culture. Chemistry of 2,7'-bi-indolyls has been developed in two main directions. Functionalization of the position 7 of the 2,7'-bi-indolyl scaffold resulted in the synthesis of carbohydrazides and glyoxyloylamides. Vilsmeier-Haack-type reactions taking place at position 7 were investigated as well. Stability of 2,7'-bi-indolyls in the presence of strong bases was explored and the unusual ring opening reaction observed. Efficient and regioselective procedures for bromination of 2,7'-bi-indolyls and quinazolin-7-ones using bromine and N-bromosuccinimide were developed to afford a wide range of novel mono-, di-, tri- and tetrabrominated derivatives. New method for the synthesis of macrocyclic tetra-indolyls via acid-catalyzed coupling of the 2'-bromo-2,7'-bi-indolyl was reported and a possible mechanism of the reaction presented. The structures of numerous quinazolin-7-one derivatives were supported by single crystal X-ray crystallography. 1,2,4,5-Tetrafluorobenzene and pentafluorobenzene were reacted with indoles and pyrrole to give the corresponding mono- and polysubstituted benzenes. An attempt was made to oxidize these molecules to azacoronenes.
Synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds that enhance the anticancer effects of Saha",2014,"Bingul, Murat"
"The tricyclic indole and tetracyclic quinoline heterocyclic systems were chosen from Naresh Kumar (NK) library in terms of their structural similarity to compounds identified from WEHI library screening. It was also of a particular interest
The electrochemistry and fluorescence studies of 2,3-diphenyl indole derivatives",2014,"Phuntsho, Nidup"
"A series of 2,3-diphenyl-4,6-dimethoxyindole derivatives with C-7 substitutions were successfully synthesized. All the novel indolyl derivatives were fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques. Electrochemical oxidation pathways for indolyl derivatives were explored using cyclic voltammetry (CV), spectroelectrochemistry and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical mechanisms of 2,3-disubstituted- 4,6-dimethoxyindole derivatives were proposed based on results obtained from the above-mentioned techniques. This thesis also includes the synthesis and use of novel indolyl ligands in metal-binding fluorescence studies. Novel indolyl chemosensors based on di-2- picolylamine (DPA) and a range of amino acids were synthesized. The chemosensors were investigated for their fluorescence response and binding modes to a group of biologically relevant metal ions. The DPA-based indole ligand was found to be Cu2+ selective, and the binding mode of the metal to the ligand was predicted to be 1:1.
Synthesis and structure-activity relationships studies of novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives as potential anti-cancer agents",2013,"Lukmantara, Adeline Yolanda"
"The primary objective of this thesis is to synthesise novel thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators and investigate their anti-proliferative activity against neoplastic cells. Traditionally, iron chelators were developed for the treatment of iron overload diseases. However, the increased requirement for iron in rapidly proliferating cells, compared with normal cells, create an opportunity to use iron as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Previous development of thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators created new iron chelators with potent and selective anti-tumour activity towards a wide variety of human and murine tumour xenografts such as 2-benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazone (BpT) and 2-(3'-nitrobenzoyl)pyridine thiosemicarbazone (NBpT). In order to understand the structure-activity relationship of the thiosemicarbazone scaffold, novel BpT analogues were designed. First attempt was made by incorporating methyl substitution on the pyridine ring and mono- or di- methoxy substitutions at the phenyl ring. In addition, incorporation of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the phenyl substituents of the N4-position of the BpT scaffold was done. Subsequently, dimerisation of BpT by forming dithiosemicarbazones using 2,6-dibenzoylpyridine were also investigated. Most of the novel thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators showed significantly higher anti-proliferative activity than the commercially available, gold-standard chelator desferrioxamine. Structure-activity relationship study revealed that the chelators with a single methyl substitutent on the pyridine ring had the highest anti-proliferative activity. Incorporation of mono- or di- substitution at the phenyl ring resulted in lower anti-proliferation activity, while methoxy substitution at the phenyl ring enhanced iron chelation efficacy. The study also indicated that benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazones with electron-donating substituents resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity than electron-withdrawing groups. The increased molecular weight of the chelators influences the lipophilicity of the ligands resulting in low or moderate potency of the chelators towards neoplastic cells. The new information provided by this study could assist in the design and synthesis of future development of thiosemicarbazone based iron chelators with higher anti-proliferative activity and iron efficacy.
The development of novel antimicrobial coatings based on dihydropyrrolones",2013,"Ho, Kitty Ka Kit"
"Bacterial infection associated with the use of biomedical devices presents a serious ongoing problem in the biomedical arena. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment is becoming less effective. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop new strategies to reduce infection associated with the use of in-dwelling biomaterials. One strategy involves impairing the bacterial communication process termed quorum sensing (QS). Dihydropyrrolones (DHPs), derived from natural quorum sensing inhibitors from Delisea pulchra, have been shown to interfere with QS of various pathogens while exhibiting low cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Therefore, DHPs represent a potential candidate for prevention of contamination and bacterial colonisation in biomedical devices. This project explores the ability of covalently tethered DHPs to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on glass and polyacrylamide beads. In this study, DHPs were immobilised onto surfaces via two specific covalent attachment strategies: Michael-type addition reaction and click chemistry. The resulting substrates were characterised using surface analysis techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and evaluated for their in vitro activities using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In vitro results of DHP-coated glass demonstrated that the covalently attached DHPs were able to prevent biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the DHP-coated surfaces showed significant reductions in bacterial adhesion without killing for both strains of bacteria, indicating DHP retained their activity when covalently attached. Moreover, the enhanced attachment of DHPs via click chemistry exhibited improved antibacterial activity over the Michael addition DHP coatings. The current study also demonstrated the effectiveness of DHP-coated polyacrylamide substrates in reducing the number of S. aureus in vivo. The results indicated that DHP-coated substrates were able to reduce the pathogenic potential of staphylococcal infection in a subcutaneous infection mouse model. Finally, the DHP substrates were analysed for their efficacy in reducing the QS of P. aeruginosa. The results indicated DHP-coated substrates were able to suppress the QS of P. aeruginosa through interaction with the AHL-regulated las QS circuit. DHPs therefore show great potential for use as an antimicrobial coating for the prevention of device-related infections.
Self-assembly and anion recognition studies of N-Glyoxylamides",2013,"Suryanti, Venty"
"The self-assembly of organic molecules has increasing potential for a range of applications including catalysis, drug delivery and tissue engineering. This work focused on the development of N-glyoxylamides as a scaffold with enhanced gelation and self-assembly properties. The N-glyoxylamides can be obtained via ring-opening reactions of N-acylisatins or N-sulfonylisatins with a range of alkyl amines. In addition, anion recognition capacity of N-glyoxylamides was also investigated. N-Glyoxylamides bearing a long hydrophobic alkyl side chain on either the glyoxylamide or amide side of the molecule were found to have enhanced self-assembly properties in solution and solid state when compared to the parent compound which favoured a dimeric conformation. The self-assembly process was dictated by a synergistic action of hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking of the aromatic groups and van der Waals interactions between alkyl chains. Conversely, N-glyoxylamides bearing hydrophobic alkyl side chains on both sides of the molecule were found to possess weaker aggregation and gelation abilities than N-glyoxylamides possessing only one alkyl side chain. Bis-glyoxylamides similarly exhibited minimal association and aggregation abilities in solution but clearly demonstrated well-defined self-assembly in the solid state, with both strong and weak molecular interactions playing key roles in stabilizing the self-assembled structures. Increasing attention has focused upon the development of anion receptors due to the environmental consequences and human health effects that arise from the presence of excess anions. N-Glyoxylamides bearing a pendant 4-nitrophenyl and 2,4-dinitrophenyl groups were synthesised where the two NH groups acted as anion binding sites and the nitrophenyl moiety acted as a signalling group. These compounds proved to be selective colorimetric sensors of CNˉ and Fˉ in acetone and formed complexes with HSO4ˉ, Clˉ, Brˉ, NO2ˉ and NO3ˉ. The N- mononitrophenylglyoxylic amide showed excellent selectivity for HSO4ˉ and formed a 1:1 host-guest complex with Clˉ in both solution and solid states. A fluorescence-based anion sensor was prepared via the ring-opening reaction of N-acetylisatin with 9,10-diaminomethylanthracene. This N-glyoxylamide with the pendant anthracene amide exhibited selective recognition of CNˉ, Fˉ and H2PO4ˉ in dimethyl sulfoxide over other examined anions, such as Clˉ, NO2ˉ, ClO4ˉ, HSO4ˉ and HPO4ˉ.
Synthesis of novel heterocyclic analogues of isoflavones",2012,"Rajput, Santosh"
"The primary aim of the project was to investigate various methodologies for the synthesis of aza-analogues of isoflavones, or 4-quinolones, and their reduced analogues with an oxygenated pattern that is present in naturally occurring flavonoids. A series of 3-aryl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-ones was synthesized by the reaction of 3,5-dimethoxyaniline with α-aryl-β-ketoesters, giving enamino esters which were then converted to the corresponding 4-quinolones by thermal cyclization. The reduced 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-one analogues were synthesized by the reaction of 3,5-dimethoxyaniline with α-aryl-β-ketoesters in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, followed by amino group protection and ester hydrolysis. The resulting acids were then cyclized and deprotected to give the desired 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones. The previously unreported 4-arylazaisoflavans were synthesized via two approaches. In the first approach, a Grignard reaction was performed on the carbonyl group of the 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones, and the resulting alcohol was dehydrated and hydrogenated to give the fully reduced ring system, with a cis arrangement of substituents. In the other approach, the carbonyl group of 2,3-dihydroquinoline was reduced to an alcohol, which was then reacted with various nucleophiles. This approach gave the corresponding 4-aryl and 4-heteroarylazaisoflavan ring systems with a trans arrangement of substituents. The pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one ring system was synthesized from 4-quinolones. The reaction of α-bromo-acetophenones with 4-quinolones gave the corresponding quinolinoketones which on acid catalyzed cyclization gave the desired pyrroloquinolin-6-one. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with lithium aluminium hydride yielded the corresponding dihydroquinolin-6-ones. Selective demethylation of the C5-methoxy group in the synthesized 4-quinolones, 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones and pyrroloquinolones was performed using cerium chloride and sodium iodide. Similar reactions with borontribromide gave dihydroxy analogues of 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-one but was found to only selectively demethylate 4-arylazaisoflavans at C5. Dimethoxyquinolones also underwent Mannich reaction at C8 with primary amines and amino acid esters to give quinazolones.
Novel antimicrobial biomaterials based on cationic peptides",2012,"Chen, Renxun"
"It is envisaged that in our technologically advanced society, every person would have a biomedical device or implant in their life time. However, bacterial infections on these life-saving devices have emerged as a major problem. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop biomaterial surfaces which resist bacterial adhesion and colonisation. Melimine is a synthetic cationic peptide with excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Further, this peptide is not cytotoxic at active concentrations and is readily heat-sterilizable. In this study, we explored the ability of Melimine to prevent bacterial adhesion when covalently tethered on glass and FEP using two attachment strategies: non-specific attachment via azide linkers and site-directed attachment via maleimide linker. The melimine coated surfaces showed excellent activity against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with up to 40-fold reduction in bacterial adhesion compared to the untreated samples in vitro. The influence of tethering parameters were also examined, peptide concentration, orientation and linker reactivity were found to be important factors to consider for optimal activity. In vivo efficacy of melimine was also demonstrated with a 1-log reduction in viable bacteria compared with the controls in a subcutaneous mouse model. Solution-based antibacterial assays were also carried out for palmitoylated melimine and melimine-coated beads. Melimine has demonstrated excellent potential for further development as an effective antimicrobial coating in the prevention of device-related infections.
Novel nitric oxide donors as antimicrobial agents",2012,"Kutty, Samuel"
"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has highlighted the need to identify new antimicrobials that target bacterial pathogenicity without bactericidal effects. One such strategy exploits the inhibition of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) pathways, which are responsible for the expression of pathogenicity traits. Nitric oxide (NO) an endogenous cell mediator is also of major interest as an antimicrobial due to its ability to disperse and inhibit microbial biofilms via non-biocidal mechanism of action. This project focuses on the design and synthesis of novel dual action NO donors based on quorum sensing inhibitors as antimicrobials. Acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) based QS inhibitors mimicking the natural autoinducers were conjugated with NO donors such as nitrates, diazeniumdiolates and S-nitrosothiol to develop novel dual action NO donors. Fimbrolides, a class of halogenated marine natural products isolated from Delisea species, are known for their potent bacterial QS inhibitory activity. A wide range of novel fimbrolide derivatives containing NO donor groups has been synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial properties. An unusual and hitherto-unknown conversion of the halogenated furanones to a thiophene skeleton was observed during preparation of thiol fimbrolides. A new class of fimbrolide disulfide compounds with no literature precedent was discovered. Dihydropyrrolone based QS inhibitors were also conjugated with nitrates to develop novel hybrids. Novel indole based C-diazeniumdiolates and high load NO donors were also synthesized. Crystal structure analyses of selected molecules revealed interesting intermolecular halogen bonding and carbonyl-carbonyl dipolar interactions. Molecular docking studies with LasR protein were also conducted to understand the influence of structural modification on the binding properties of the molecules. Docking studies also displayed possibilities of halogen bonding interactions in the ligand binding site. The newly synthesized compounds were analyzed for their QS inhibitory efficacy and NO release properties in in-vitro assays. Their efficacy in biofilms inhibition and dispersion was also evaluated. The novel NO hybrid compounds showed significant biological activity which highlighted their potential for further development.
The synthesis of novel, biologically active isoflavone analogues",2012,"Eiffe, Eleanor Jane"
"This thesis explores the synthesis of novel isoflavone analogues, with a particular focus on isoflavonoid compounds that are substituted at C2 or C4. Isoflavylium salts were prepared via the treatment of isoflavenes with tritylium hexafluorophosphate or thallium trifluoroacetate. The reactivity of these salts towards nucleophiles was exploited to generate a diverse series of 2-substituted isoflavenes. Isoflavylium salts reacted readily with alkylzinc reagents, primary and secondary amines, thiols, indoles and α-methyl ketones. Some of the isoflavenes generated in this manner were reduced to the corresponding isoflavans. 2-Substituted isoflavenes were also synthesised via an alternative route. 2-Substituted isoflavones were prepared via the cyclisation of deoxybenzoins with symmetrical anhydrides or acyl chlorides. Reduction of the 2-substituted isoflavones to the corresponding isoflavanols, followed by acid-catalysed dehydration afforded 2- substituted isoflavenes. 2-Substitituted isoflavones were also partially reduced to the corresponding isoflavanones, which can serve as precursors to the synthesis of 4- substituted isoflavonoid compounds. Isoflavene epoxides were also explored as potential precursors to 4-substituted isoflavonoid species. Novel epoxides were prepared via the oxidation of isoflavenes with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. This reaction was found to generate meta- chlorobenzoate ester side products. These esters were converted to the corresponding epoxides via treatment with acid. The biological activity of 2-substitued isoflavenes was also investigated. A number of the analogues synthesised as part of this project exhibited promising anti-cancer activity.
Synthesis of novel Indole-based Macrocycles",2012,"Chen, Rui"
"The formation of novel indolo-macrocyclic imines derived from N,N -diindolylxylene dialdehydes has been investigated. The xylene linkage between two indole units was found to contribute to the rigidity of the systems, and allows the selective condensations of N,N -diindolylxylene dialdehydes with diamino compounds. N,N -Diindolylxylene-3,3 -dialdehyde underwent cyclization only with 1,2-diaminoethane to afford an 18-membered cyclic diimine while N,N -diindolylxylene-7,7 -dialdehyde was only able to form a 19-membered cyclic diimine with 1,3-diaminopropane. Both kinds of imines could be reduced to the corresponding macrocyclic amines, by reductions with sodium borohydride. Novel calix[3]indoles have been synthesized via two different strategies of acid-catalyzed addition reactions. In the first method, the indolo 2,7-dimethanols were cyclized with bis-indoles under acidic conditions. In the second method, bis-indole-3,3 -dimethanols were cyclized with active indoles. Attempts to synthesize macrocyclic structures containing more than four indole units via stepwise acid-catalyzed addition reactions failed due to the fact that the methylene linkages between the indole units were not stable under acidic conditions. Tin(IV) chloride catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions were found to give novel 2 ,7-biindolyls and 2,2 -biindolyls. An investigation of the mechanism of this unusual bi-aryl coupling reaction was carried out. Through optimization of conditions it was found that in the mixture of dichloromethane and nitromethane, tin(IV) chloride could form tin-indole intermediates with active indoles and under mild heat a series of novel biindolyls can be obtained in moderate yield. Further investigations of the reactivity of the new biindolyls and syntheses of biindolyl based macrocycles were carried out. The N,N -substitution of biindolyls gave the pyrrolophenanthridone analogues. The formylation of biindolyls gave mono- and di-formyl biindolyls, which were subsequently condensed with different diamino compounds to afford various 1:1 and 2:2 macrocyclic imines. Reduction of the di-formyl biindolyl gave the biindolyl dimethanol which could yield two different types of semi-calix[4]indoles in one-pot and stepwise manners. Oxidation reactions of biindolyls produced an indorphyrin with related tetraindolyl macrocycles in moderate yields. Different molecular shapes as well as the related supramolecular chemistry of tetraindolyl macrocycles were further investigated via X-ray crystallography studies.
Synthesis of new heterocycle-linked BIS-indole systems",2011,"Sengul, Ibrahim Fazil"
"The primary aim of this project was to synthesize relatively large molecular structures derived from novel 2- and 3-indolyl compounds and to investigate their properties and reactivity. 3,6-Bis-(2-indolyl)-dibenzofurans and 3,6-bis-(2-indolyl)-carbazoles were synthesized from 3,6-diacetyldibenzofuran, and 3,6-diacetylcarbazole and their derivatives via the Fischer indole synthesis. Further, the modified Bischler indole synthesis was used to generate 3,6-bis-(3-indolyl)-dibenzofurans derived from 3,6-diacetyldibenzofuran. The most reactive positions of the 2- and 3-indolyl compounds were formylated using the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction to yield the related bis-indole dicarbaldehydes in excellent yields. In addition, the dicarbaldehydes were subsequently reduced to the corresponding bis-indole dimethanols. The attempted synthesis of macrocyclic indoles from the related bis-indole dimethanols by acid catalysed reactions is described in this study. A new range of 2,3'-bis-biindolyl derivatives was synthesized using two different strategies. In the first method, the 2-substiuted bis-indoles were reacted with oxindoles in the presence of phosphoryl chloride. In the second method, the biindolyl compounds were prepared from the acid catalysed reaction of 2-substituted bis-indoles and bromoindoles. Similarly, the reaction of 3,6-bis-(3-indolyl)-dibenzofuran with oxindole generated the corresponding 2,7-bis-biindolyl ring system. The widespread applications of Schiff bases in medicinal chemistry are very significant. The reactivity of the 3,3'-diformyl-3,6-bis-(2-indolyl)-dibenzofurans and related carbazoles was exploited to prepare indole-containing imine macrocyclic compounds by treating the bis-indole dicarbaldehydes with 1,4-diaminobutane and 1,6-diaminohexane. The formation of macrocycles was dependent upon the size and the shape of the linker diamino compounds. The related amine macrocycles were prepared through sodium borohydride reduction of imines. The 2-indolyl compounds were acylated utilizing oxalyl chloride and trichloroacetyl chloride, and subsequently led to the generation of a new class of bis-indole esters and amides. Additionally, the construction of cyclic indolyldiamide systems from bis-gyloxylesters and amides and bis-trichloroacetyl indoles was investigated. Ten compounds were selected for biological testing and three compounds in particular were found to have anti-cancer activity in vitro assays
Synthesis of novel BIS-indole systems",2011,"Kandemir, Hakan"
"The primary aim of this project was to synthesize novel 2,2′- and 7,7′-linked bis-indole systems from methoxy activated indoles, and investigate their ability to undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions at C7 and C2 respectively. As an integral part of achieving this aim, the development of a new series of methoxy activated indole precursors was investigated. The construction of hydrazine bridged 2,2′- and 7,7′-linked bis-indoles was achieved from 2- and 7-glyoxylchlorides and 2- and 7- trichloroacetylindoles respectively. An efficient method was developed for the preparation of 7,7′-bis-indoles containing an oxadiazole derived spacer unit via the cyclodehydration of 7,7′- hydrazide linked bis-indoles. The preparation of a series of monomeric 1,3,4-thiadiazoles was also successfully achieved via the cyclodehydration of 2- and 7-thiosemicarbazides. Some of these 7,7′-hydrazine bridged bis-indoles showed promising antibacterial activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Based on these interesting biological results, some novel 7-carbohydrazides and 7-carboxamides were prepared in order to determine the effect of other substituents at the C7 position. A 7-aminomethylindole was synthesised by the reduction of the corresponding 7-cyanoindole and used as a functional precursor to prepare a range of 7,7′-bis-indoles Also, the reduction of 7-nitroethyl indoles led to the formation of 7-tryptamine analogues. These were used to generate amide and imine linked 7,7′-bis-indoles and for the construction of imine linked macrocycles, which were subsequently reduced to the corresponding amine linked macrocycles. 7-Bromoindoles are key intermediates for the synthesis of biindolyl systems. However, all attempts to synthesize 7-bromoindoles failed, but interestingly led to the generation of unexpected compounds such as 4,6-dimethoxybenzotriazole. This led to the subsequent investigation of the C7 reactivity of this system by exploring reactions such as formylation, acylation and acid catalysed dimerization. The synthesis of 7-oxotryptamines was accomplished via hydrogenation of the corresponding 7-acyl cyanides. 7-Oxotryptamines were subsequently reacted with 7-trichloroacetyindoles to form amide linked bis-indoles, which were converted to the oxazole linked bis-indoles. Some monomeric 7-methyloxazoles were also prepared from the 7-keto amides via cyclodehydration. However, the synthesis of 7-hydroxy tryptamine was unsuccessful and led to the formation of a dimer and an alcohol.
A systematic approach to understanding organic reactivity in ionic liquids: changes in cybotacticity-induced solvent heterogeneity as an important determinant In reaction outcomes of substitution processes",2011,"Yau, Hon Man"
"Described herein is the initial development towards a general framework for predicting changes in organic reactivity in ionic liquids through the mechanistic studies of several representative substitution processes with well-defined mechanisms. The temperature-dependent kinetic behaviour of the ethanolysis of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a model nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction was examined in molecular and ionic solvents. Activation parameters obtained and relevant molecular dynamics simulations performed highlight the importance of cybotactic regions characterised by anion-π interaction. Activation parameters and free energy relationships for the Menschutkin reactions between pyridine and a series of substituted benzyl bromides and unsubstituted benzyl halides in both molecular and ionic liquid solvents were investigated. The Menschutkin reaction was found to be entropically favoured in ionic liquid regardless of the leaving group involved. By systematically replacing the aromatic starting materials with non-aromatic ones, the effect of delocalised electron density in either the electrophile or the nucleophile of the aforementioned Menschtkin reaction was evaluated. Cybotacticity associated with nitrogen centre in the nucleophiles and related changes were found to be responsible for changes in reactivity observed on changing solvent to the ionic liquid and are consistent with related molecular dynamics simulations of the starting materials. Kinetic analyses were also carried out for the reaction between 1-(1-chloroethyl)-4-methoxybenzene and pyridine, which proceeds through both unimolecular and bimolecular pathways simultaneously. The results are discussed in relation to the bimolecular Menschutkin reactions presented in the early chapters of this thesis as well as previous work on a unimolecular substitution process and the potential for solvent-controlled reactivity is discussed. The Menschutkin reaction between benzyl bromide and pyridine was investigated in ionic liquids composed of either a 1,3- dialkylimidazolium cation or a 1,2,3-trialkylimidazolium cation. The generality of electrostatic interactions and the impact of charge density were examined based on the activation parameters obtained from temperature-dependent kinetics analysis. A general ""one-pot"" method for obtaining relative rates of reaction in complex mixtures has been established through the construction of free energy relationships for various reactions under competitive conditions. The advantages of the technique, compared to existing methods in the literature, are discussed in terms of accuracy, efficiency and applicability.
Synthesis of novel antimicrobial agents",2011,"Zhang, Ruonan"
"This thesis presents the development offuranones and peptidomimetics as novel antimicrobial agents that inhibit quorum sensing in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively. A versatile synthetic route to generate novel furanone compounds was developed. Ketones bearing bulky C3-substituents such as iso-propyl or tert-butyl underwent C1-selective condensation with glyoxylic acid to afford 4-oxohept-2-enoic acids which were brominated, dehydratedin the presence of phosphorus pentoxide and dehydrobrominated with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) to give 3-bromo-5-propylidenefuran-2-ones. Conversely, treatment with sulfuric acid gave 4-bromo-5-propylidenefuran-2-ones in one step.The related dihydropyrrolone compounds were also obtained through a lactone-lactamization reaction. Ketones bearing less bulky alkyl groups underwent C3-selective condensation with glyoxylic acid to give 3-acetylpent-2-enoic acids which were brominated and cyclised to give 4-alkyl-3-bromo-5-methylenefuranones. Further bromination and dehydrobromination gave the corresponding 5-bromomethylene analogues. 4-Aryl-5-bromomethylene furanones were similarly prepared. Cyclization of aryl-substituted alkenoic acids in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide gave poor yields, however, good yields were obtained upon treatment with thionyl chloride to give the related 4-aryl-5-chlorofuranones. The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction was employed as an alternate strategy towards aryl-substituted furanones, with a series of 3-aryl, 4-aryl and 5-arylidene furanones being prepared in good yields. 4-Bromo-5-(bromomethylene) furan-2(5H)-one was found to preferentially react at the exocyclic vinylic bromo substituent in the presence of one equivalent of the boronic acid and generate the related diaryl analogue when an excess was used. This reactivity was exploited to develop unsymmetrically substituted diaryl furanones. 5-Fluoromethylene furanones were prepared via condensation of fluoroketones with glyoxylic acid. Alternatively, 5-hydroxylfuranones were converted to 5-fluorofuranones using diethylaminosulfur trifluoride(DAST). Direct conversion of a bromide atom to a fluoride was unsuccessful. Novel peptidomimetics were prepared using the facilenucleophilic ring-opening reaction of N-acetylisatin.Different bis-N-acetylisatins were prepared via the Sandmeyer isonitrosoacetanilide isatin synthesis and their ring-opening reactions with amines, alcohols and amino acid methyl esters wereinvestigated.
Synthesis of novel flavones and isoflavones",2011,"Devakaram, Ruth Vandana"
"The primary aim of this project is to synthesize new heterocyclic compounds derived from flavones and isoflavones and thereby, to investigate various methodologies for their synthesis. The biflavonoid, dependensin was a major focus of our study since the benzopyrano[4,3-b]benzopyran ring system present in the natural product was unique and hence, desirable for biological applications. We targeted the acid-catalyzed reactions of 5-methoxy-, 6-methoxy- and 7-methoxyflavenes and found the dimerization to be dependent on the position of the methoxy substituent in the flavene ring. A series of benzopyrano[4,3-b]benzopyrans was generated from the acid-catalyzed reactions of 7-methoxyflavenes and 5,7,8-trimethoxyflavenes. Interestingly, the acid-catalyzed reactions attempted on 5-methoxy- and 6-methoxyflavenes were found to undergo dimerization differently to yield a novel range of biflavonoids containing the tetrahydrochromeno[2,3-b]chromene ring system. A plausible mechanism for the observed rearrangement has also been proposed. The effect of various acids used as catalysts on the dimerization reactions has been evaluated and discussed in this thesis. Similarly, the acid-catalyzed dimerization reactions on isoflavanols and their corresponding isoflavenes were studied in depth and dimerization was found to be dependent on the presence of electron rich substituents in ring B of the isoflavanols and also in performing the reaction in very cold conditions. A probable rationale to this rearrangement has been described. The widespread applications of Mannich bases in medicinal chemistry are noteworthy. Hence, another part of the project was to study the Mannich reactions on flavones using various primary and secondary amines, aminals and amino acids and to probe into the regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of the products obtained. The key point of interest to note was the site of activation in the flavone ring, which was C5 in 6-hydroxyflavones and C8 in 7-hydroxyflavones. The primary amines yielded benzoxazines whereas the secondary amines, aminals and amino acids yielded simple Mannich bases. Further, the benzoxazines were found to undergo cleavage to generate the corresponding simple Mannich bases. Our research group has previously worked on the synthesis of a series of 4-arylflavans and 4-arylisoflavans, but however, there are no reports on the synthesis of 4-arylazaflavans in the literature. Hence, 4-arylazaflavans were synthesized via the acid-catalyzed reactions of azaflavanols with nucleophiles such as naphthol and dimethoxyphenol, whereas 4-heteroarylazaflavans were obtained using heterocycles such as furan, indoles and isoflavenes. Attempts were made to synthesize the corresponding azaflavenes with the primary aim on subjecting them to acid-catalyzed dimerization reactions similar to the flavenes. However, the dominant product isolated was the corresponding quinoline in all cases. Several experiments were conducted in order to oxidize the 4-arylazaflavans to the corresponding quinolines. The optimum conditions were achieved with the use of iodine as catalyst. This introduces a new strategy to the synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted quinolines.
Synthesis of new fused heterocyclic systems",2010,"Khan, Taj Usman"
"The primary aim of this project was to synthesize novel 4,6-dihydroxyindoles and 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones and to study their reactivity. 4,6-Dibenzyloxyindoles were synthesised from 3,5-dibenzyloxyaniline. The synthesis of 3,5-dibenzyloxyaniline was initially attempted using a modified Curtius reaction. However, this method was not efficient due to the requirement of multiple steps and a low yield in the penultimate step. To overcome this, an alternative synthesis starting from phloroglucinol was optimised which gave 3,5-dibenzyloxyaniline in four steps in 84% overall yield. By employing 3,5-dibenzyloxyaniline, a variety of indoles were prepared using methods such as the Bischler, modified Bischler and Hemetsberger indole syntheses. A one-pot reaction for the synthesis of 2-substituted indoles, 2,3-disubstituted indoles and 3-substituted indoles was investigated. The reactivity studies on 4,6-dibenzyloxyindoles included formylation, bromination, the Mannich reaction, the synthesis of indolylmethanes and biindolyls. Using 4,6-dihydroxyindoles a new class of heterocyclic pyrano[2,3-g]indoles was prepared via the von Pechmann reaction in 60-73% yield. Pyrano[2,3-f]indoles were also prepared from 5-aminoresorcinol employing the Bischler indole synthesis in 62-65% yield. Selected pyranoindoles were tested and found to have anti-cancer and anti-fungal activity in the in vitro assays. The secondary aim of the project was to construct fused heterocyclic systems derived from 4,6-dihydroxyindoles and 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones. Furoindoles were synthesised using two different methods. In the first method, the hydroxy group of 4,6-dihydroxyindole at C4 was reacted with α-haloketones to give acyl intermediates which were readily cyclised at C5 by trifluoroacetic acid to give furoindoles in 72-83% yield. In the second method 4-hydroxy-2,3-diphenylindole was used to make a variety of substituted furoindoles in 73-78% yield following a similar method. Dihydropyranoindoles were prepared in four steps with average yield of 71-77% using a modification of the Hemetsberger indole synthesis. These reactions generated four different kinds of novel dihydropyranoindoles. 5,7-Dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were synthesised from phloroglucinol in good 73-76% yield over two steps. 5,7-Dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were reacted further with α-haloketones followed by cyclization in trifluoroacetic acid to give difuroquinolones in 58-86% yield. Mannich adducts were obtained in 65-67% yield through the reaction of 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones with bis(dimethylamino)methane, whereas oxazinoquinolones were obtained in 63-73% yield when 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were reacted with benzylamine and formaldehyde. Pyrroloquinolines were prepared in a one-step method using indole-7-carbaldehyde and acrylonitrile. This is demonstrated to be a facile method to generate pyrroloquinolines in 70-84% yield.
The synthesis and reactions of new activated indole derivatives",2010,"Bingul, Murat"
"A range of methyl dimethoxyindole-2-carboxylate derivatives has successfully been prepared via the Hemetsberger reaction. The most reactive positions of the indole esters were formylated using the Vilsmeier Haack reaction to yield the related indole carbaldehyde compounds in excellent yields and purity. While methyl 4,5-dimethoxyindole- and 4,6-dimethoxyindole-2-carboxylate underwent nucleophilic substitution exclusively at the C7 position, substitution occurred at C4 and C6 in the case of methyl 5,6-dimethoxyindole and 4,7-dimethoxyindole-2-carboxylate, respectively. The reactivity of methyl 4,7-dimethoxyindole-2-carboxylate was further exploited to prepare the 2,6'biindolyl system by the treating the corresponding indole with 2-indolinone and phosphoryl chloride. The self-condensation of activated methyl hydroxymethyl-indole esters afforded a variety of diindolylmethanes under acidic conditions due to the insistent reactivity of the most nucleophilic positions of the corresponding indoles. A range of unsymmetrical diindolylmethanes was also synthesised from the acid catalysed reaction of methyl 4-hydroxymethylindole-2-carboxylate and methyl dimethoxyindole esters. The reduction of the methyl ester located at C2 afforded a range of 2-hydroxymethylindole derivatives which were oxidised with manganese dioxide to afford new dimethoxyindole-2-carbaldehyde compounds in good yield and purity. The 2-hydroxymethylindole derivatives were also treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid to prepare a series of nine-membered trimeric systems. However, 5,6-dimethoxy-2-hydroxymethylindole was found to be less reactive to form the corresponding trimer. The treatment of activated indole-2-carbaldehydes with nitromethane afforded the structurally important 2-(2-nitrovinyl)indole derivatives which could be useful for the future synthesis of biologically active drug targets. The potential the formylated methyl indole esters for the construction of pyrroloindole and indoloindole systems using the Hemetsberger indole synthesis was investigated. Furthermore, a range of known dicarbaldehdes was also examined in this reaction, however in all cases the corresponding indole-carbaldehydes were found to possess insufficient reactivity towards ethyl azidoacetate. The applicability of the Hemetsberger indole synthesis for the construction of indoloindole systems from naphthalene-2,6-dicarbaldehyde and naphthalene-1,5-dicarbaldehyde was investigated. A new interesting indoloindole system was successfully synthesised from naphthalene-1,5-dicarbaldehyde and naphthalene-2,6-dicarbaldehyde in good yield and purity.
New cyclization reactions of indoles",2010,"Qu, Ji"
"The thesis is mainly concerned with the development of synthetic strategies for the synthesis of new heterocyclic systems based on indoles, and which are related to natural products. A versatile route to indolo[3,2-c]isoquinolines has been found, making use of the acid catalyzed cyclization of indole-3-amides, which in turn were obtained by the Beckmann rearrangement of the related indole-3-oximes. Interestingly, the application of different reaction conditions for the Beckmann rearrangement, lead to the isolation of either the indole-3-amines or indole-3-amides, and these can then be used for further reactions. During an investigation of the scope of this research, a new route for the synthesis of highly substituted indoloimidazole compounds was discovered. These imidazole compounds were formed by an unusual acid catalyzed intermolecular combination of two 2-phenylindole-3-amides. As part of the continuation of our interest in cyclization reactions, bond formation between nucleophilic indole systems and pendant iminium electrophiles was investigated in a variety of cases. This study led to a ring expansion reaction of 3-substituted-4,6-dimethoxy-2-arylindoles, that generated a range of new benzonaphthyridine derivatives when the indoles and iminium substrates were heated with phosphoryl chloride in acetonitrile. Further research also demonstrated the synthesis of indolobenzodiazepines in good yield by an unusual cyclization reaction. In this case, the initial product of activated 3-arylindoles with 2-acetamidobenzyl chloride was further heated with phosphoryl chloride. In all of this work, the significance of the additional reactivity of indoles provided by the methoxy groups is noteworthy.
New heterocyclic systems derived from activated indoles",2010,"Wood, Kasey Cherie"
"This thesis explores the use of activated 3-substituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles in the preparation of new indole-based heterocyclic systems. Novel pyrrolo[a]indole dimers were synthesized via acid catalysed condensation of 3-substituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles with acetone and p-substituted acetophenones. General activation of the indole scaffold was found to improve the efficiency and versatility of the reaction when compared to the parent skatole, though a steric limitation was apparent. The bis-indole nature of this system was also exploited to produce a range of mixed indole dimers. The formation of the reaction product was found to be dependent upon the acidity of the reaction mixture, with a spiropyrrolo[a]indole dimer preferentially forming in the presence of a weak acid. 9H-Pyrrolo[1,2-a]indoles were prepared through acid catalysed condensation of 3-substituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles with a range of chalcones. Conversely, condensations with alkyl α,β-unsaturated ketones were preferentially found to undergo polymerization. General activation of the indole scaffold was found to improve the reaction time and product yield when compared to the parent system. The C2 position was identified as the most reactive position of these 9H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]indoles and the inability to introduce a C5-carbaldehyde functionality hindered subsequent oxidation to the 4,7-indoloquinone scaffold. The ability of 4,6-dimethoxyindoles to specifically activate the indole C7 position was exploited to develop innovative synthetic routes to indoles 1,7-annulated with medium sized rings. In particular, a ring closing metathesis strategy was employed to prepare indoles fused with eight and nine membered cycloalkanes and lactones. Ring closure of larger rings proved unfavourable, hindering the synthesis of ten and eleven membered cycloalkane and glyoxylic ester analogues. Similarly, the development of indole fused lactams was hampered by several of the pathway intermediates displaying undesirable reactivities. A new type of indole flavonoid hybrid was prepared though treatment of 7-nitrovinylindoles with salicylaldehyde in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. However, the reaction was found to be unable to tolerate changes to the reactivity of the aldehyde.
Synthesis of a novel class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins",2008,"Cheah, Wai Ching"
"The primary aim of this thesis was to synthesize a new class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins and to investigate various methodologies for their synthesis. N-Acetylisatin 15 and its derivatives 39 and 40 were found to undergo facile nucleophilic ring-opening with amino acid esters yielding a range of 2-acetamidophenylglyoxylamide derivatives in moderate to good yields. This type of reaction was also found to work for di- and tripeptide methyl ester hydrochlorides leading to a range of N-glyoxylamide peptide mimics. The methodology of the reaction conditions was further extended to N,N′-oxalyl bisisatins 17 and 134, and 1,3,5-tris(2,3-dioxoindoline-1-carbonyl)benzene 168 substrates and their reaction with amino acid esters gave a new range of C,C′-linked-bis-glyoxylamide peptide mimics and C,C′,C′′-linked tris-glyoxylamide peptide mimics respectively. Meanwhile, reactions of N-acylisatins with 1,10-diaminodecane 155 and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine 167 gave the corresponding bis and tris-glyoxylamides. In the event of introducing amino acids at the N-1 position of isatin 9, a range of NH protecting groups for the synthesis of N-protected amino acid acyl isatins 193 were examined. It was found that the phthalamido group, e.g. phthaloylglycine 197, was the best protecting group for the introduction of a glycine unit at the N-1 position of isatin 9. Additionally, a viable and interesting alternative approach utilizing N-succinyl acylisatin 158 as the starting material was also demonstrated. In continuation of our interest in the peptidomimetic approach, a new class of cyclic peptide mimics using Grubbs ring-closing metathesis approach was also successfully synthesized. A range of bis-O-allyl substrates 237, 240, 242 and 246 were prepared from reaction of the corresponding N-acylisatins with L-valine allyl ester hydrochloride 236 and 1,10- diaminodecane 155 respectively. High conversion yields of the target macrocyclic systems 238, 241 and 243 were observed when the bis-Oallyl substrates were irradiated with Hoveyda-Grubb catalyst in a microwave reactor. These latter studies will provide a synthetically versatile platform for the future design of potential new drugs candidates against Gram-positive bacterial infections
Identification of mammalian lipid material by high performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry",2008,"Proschogo, Nicholas William"
"The analysis of the exact compositions of human lipids is of great importance and can lead to a better understanding of the role of lipids in heart diseases and diabetes. Reverse phase and normal phase high performance liquid chromatography has been used for the analysis of lipid material and applied to beef dripping. Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry has been used to investigate the free fatty acids, monoacylglycerides, diacylglycerides and triacylglycerides present in lard and beef dripping with the general conclusion that this is a semi quantitative method. Collision induced dissociation of di- and triacylglycerides was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with the energy of activation for the fragmentation process investigated and compared using density functional theory and Rice Ramsperger Kassel Marcus statistical theory of fragmentation. The application of tandem mass spectrometry to mice and human cell cultures and plaques from the abdominal aorta of rabbits was conducted using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry.
Novel antagonists of bacterial signaling pathways",2008,"Goh, Wai Kean"
"Traditional bacterial disease therapies utilize compounds that ultimately kill the target bacteria but it exerts a strong selective pressure on the bacteria to develop multi-drug resistance mutants. The increasing occurrence of resistance in common pathogens has highlighted the need to identify new anti-microbials that target the control of bacterial pathogenicity in a non-extermination manner to reduce the incidence of bacteria resistance. One new strategy exploits the discrete signaling molecules that regulate the various bacterial signaling pathways, which are responsible for the expression of pathogenicity traits. Halogenated furanones (fimbrolides) from the marine red alga, Delisea pulchra have been shown to interfere with the key signaling pathway present in Gram-negative bacteria by competitively displacing the cognate signaling molecule from the transcription protein. This project focused on the design and synthesis of 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones, a new class of fimbrolide derivatives capable of displaying strong antagonistic properties of the fimbrolides. Primary synthetic methodologies examined include the halolactamization of allenamides and the direct lactone-lactam transformation. No doubt, both methodologies yielded the lactam ring, the former failed to introduce the crucial C-5 bromomethylene group essential for bioactivity. A facile high yielding two-step lactone-lactam transformation method was developed and using this method, a wide range of substituted 5-bromomethyl- and 5-dibromomethylene-1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones were synthesized. Furthermore, a new class of tricyclic crown-ether type compounds with no literature precedent were discovered. To vary the diversity of the compounds, a related class of compounds, 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones, were examined. A general versatile method for the synthesis of 7-substituted 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones was developed. The synthetic strategy proceeds via the established Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of halogenated dihydroindol-2-ones with arylboronic acids/esters. The Suzuki methodology was found to be reliable in furnishing a wide range of 7-substituted products in high yields. A preliminary molecular modeling approach was used to assist in the design of new anti-microbials via the ligand-docking analyses of the TraR and LasR protein. A positive correlation was observed between the docking scores and biological activity and the methodology was further developed into an initial screening tool to filter potential active and non-active compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were analysed for their efficacy in reducing the expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the presence of natural AHL signaling molecules in an AHL-monitor strain, indicative of the inhibition of bacterial phenotype expression. The dihydropyrrol-2-one class of compounds showed significant biological activity and this highlighted their potential for further development.
Synthesis of heterocyclic analogues of phytoestrogens",2008,"Leu, Chao-Wei"
"The pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one ring system was synthesised from 3-aryl-4,6-dimethoxyindoles and 2,3-disubstituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles. The reaction of 4,6-dimethoxyindoles under Friedel-Crafts or Vilsmeier-Haack acylation gave the 2- and 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins in good yield. Cyclisation of 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal as a one carbon reagent gave the pyrroloquinolin-6-ones in high yield. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with hydrogen gas and 10% palladium on carbon or lithium aluminium hydride yielded the dihydropyrroloquinolin-6-ones. Demethylation of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid gave a mixture of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy analogues in high yield. The synthesis of quinolin-4-ones using the Conrad-Limpach method was attempted using three different cyclisation conditions such as Dowtherm A, polyphosphoric acid and a mixture of diphenyl ether and methanesulfonic acid. Quinolin-2-ones such as 4-methyl-3-aryl-, 3,4-diaryl- and 3-aryl-4-benzyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones could be synthesised from either the N-phenylacetylaniline or the N-trifluoroacetyl aniline strategy. Attempted reduction of the quinolin-2-ones with standard metal hydride reagents was unsuccessful. However reduction was achieved via the conversion of quinolin-2-one to the corresponding 2-chloroquinoline followed by reaction of the chloroquinoline with zinc powder and glacial acetic acid to produce a novel, highly substituted quinoline system. Demethylation was successfully carried out with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid to give the trihydroxyquinolin-2-one in high yield. The reactions of 4-substituted-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones and the corresponding 2-chloroquinolines as potential organic intermediates were explored. Facile formylation of both quinolin-2-ones and 2-chloroquinolines was observed under Vilsmeier-Haack conditions while acetylation was successful under Friedel-Crafts conditions using antimony (V) pentachloride as the Lewis acid. Further reaction of 8-formyl-quinolin-2-one with 1,2-diaminobenzene in N,N-dimethylformamide led to the formation of a new 8-(benzimidazolyl)-quinolin-2-one ring system. The quinolin-2-ones exhibited selective electrophilic substitution at the C8 position for a range of reactions. However, an unexpected nitration occurred at the C3 position for the 4-methoxy and 4-phenyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones with good yields. A series of novel 4,6-hydroxylindoles was successfully synthesised from the corresponding methoxy analogues in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride. When 3-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-dimethoxyindole was reacted with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid a 2,2?-indolylindoline dimer was formed. The 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were similarly synthesised in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride in chlorobenzene.
Synthesis of new heterocyclic structures based on indoles",2007,"Somphol, Kittiya"
"Novel indolo-macrocycles have been generated from the attempts to synthesise bis-indolo-cyclotriveratrylenes by the condensation of I, I'-diindolyl-3,3'-dimethanols catalysed by p-toluenesulfonic acid. The addition of substituents on indoles led to enhanced solubilities of the macrocycles. Nine- and six-membered ring compounds have been synthesized from the acid-catalysed reaction of I,I'-diindolyl compounds and aryl aldehydes. Some reactions of these compounds and the attempted synthesis of 2,2' diindolylmethanes from the cyclic compounds have also been described. The electrophilic substitution reactions of 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindole 2,6-dimethanols and 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindole-7 and 2-carbaldehydes and I-substituted indoles afforded triindolyl dialdehydes. The wriation of substituents at C-7 of indole-7-aldehydes and at C-2 of indole-2-aldehydes has also been discussed. Reaction of the hydroxymethylindole and 1,2-di(indol-I-ylmethyl)benzene gave a new macrocycle. Substitution reactions of 2,2'diindolylmethane-7,7'-dimethanol and indole-7- and 2-aldehydes gave tetraindolyl dialdehydes. Sodium borohydride reduction of tri- and tetra-indolyl dialdehydes gave tri- and tetra-indolyl dimethanols respectively. Acid-catalysed reactions of tri- and tetra-indolyl dimethanols afforded only calix[3] and [4]indoles respectively when all substituents at C-3 of indoles were aryl groups. New conditions for indole based imine synthesis have been established Macrocyclic imine formation from mono-, di-, tri and tetra-indolyl dialdehydes has been investigated. Reactions of indole-3, 7-dialdehydes and short chain diamines (1,2-diaminoethane, 1,2-diaminobenzene and 1,6-diaminohexane) gave mixtures while the reactions with long chain diamines (1,10 diaminodecane and 1,12-diaminododecane) gave monoindolyl macrocyclic imines. Reaction of indole-2, 7-dialdehydes and short chain diamines afforded diindolyl macrocyclic imines with head-tail structures, and the 2,7'2',2""7"",2'''-Tetraindole-7 ,7""'-dialdehyde underwent cyclisation with triindolyl dialdehydes and 1,6-diaminohexane afforded triindolyl macrocyclic imines. 1,2 diaminoethane while the 2,3 '1',1 ""3 "",2""'-tetraindole-7,7""'-dialdehydes underwent imine, with its precise structure established by X-ray crystallography. Reaction of of 1,3-di(indol-l-ylmethyl)benzene and 1,2 diaminoethane yielded a new macrocyclic reactions with long chain diamines yielded monoindolyl macrocyclic imines. Reaction ring closure with 1,2 diaminoethane and 1,6-diaminohexane.
Synthesis of heterocyclic dimers derived from isoflavones and flavones.",2007,"Deodhar, Mandar"
"The primary aim of this project was to synthesize new heterocyclic dimers of isoflavones and flavones, and investigate various methodologies for their synthesis. The secondary aim of the project was to synthesize some flavonoid natural products. Dimeric systems were synthesized using various methodologies including acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols and flavanols, acid catalyzed dimerization of flavenes, oxidative dimerization, Sonogashira coupling, Ullmann coupling and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions. The acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols was found to proceed in a very stereoselective fashion to give trans-4-arylisoflavans in good yield in a single step. However, related flavanols under similar conditions gave mixtures of cis and trans isomers of 4-arylflavans. Interestingly, it was found that appropriately substituted flavenes, upon treatment with acid undergo stereoselective rearrangement and dimerization to give benzopyranobenzopyrans in high yields. A rationale for the rearrangement is proposed and this dimerization was used for the stereoselective synthesis of the natural product dependensin. As part of the project, some polycyclic natural products such as octandrenolone, flemiculosin, 3-deoxy-MS-II and laxichalcone were also synthesized. Oxidative dimerization of activated isoflavones was found to be very regioselective, and novel isoflavone dimeric systems were synthesized. Related flavones however, failed to undergo dimerization under similar conditions. A probable explanation for high regioselectivity in the case of isoflavones and unreactivity of flavones has been presented. Phenol oxidative coupling was used for the one-step synthesis of another natural product kudzuisoflavone-A from daidzein. Sonogashira coupling was utilized for the synthesis of dimeric systems linked via an acetylic linker. A variety of soflavone isoflavone, flavone-flavone and isoflavone-flavone dimers were synthesized in ""one-pot"" by this methodology and in excellent yields. Although Ullmann coupling was found not to be suitable for the synthesis of isoflavone or flavone dimers, one-pot Suzuki-Miyaura methodology gave flavone dimers and various other heterocyclic dimers in good yields.
Synthesis and reactivity of some activated heterocyclic compounds",2007,"Alamgir, Mahiuddin"
"An alternate approach to the synthesis of calix[3]indoles has been demonstrated, but further attempted synthetic approaches to calixindoles using new leaving groups led to uncharacterized polymeric products. The synthesis of new 7,7'-diindolylmethane- 2,2'-dicarbaldehydes gives potential for further ligand design and metal complex formation. In addition, 4,6-dimethoxyindole-7- carbaldehydes have been effectively converted to a range of 6-methoxyindole-4,7-diones by Dakin oxidation. Various electrophilic substitution reactions have been performed on the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles. Formylation, acylation, acid catalyzed addition of formaldehyde and nitration revealed that the activated benzimidazoles are less reactive at the specified C-7 position compared to the analogous indoles. The key starting material for a potential calixbenzimidazole was synthesized by the selenium dioxide oxidation of 2-methyl-7-formyl-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazole and by oxidative cleavage of 4,6-dimethoxy- 2-styrylbenzimidazole by Lemieux-Johnson reagent followed by reduction. Nevertheless, attempted preparation of calixbenzimidazole from 2-hydroxymethyl-4,6-dimethoxy benzimidazole led to formation of a dibenzimidazolyl ether. The synthesis of some novel activated bisbenzimidazoles has been developed. Furthermore, benzimidazoles were incorporated into new ligand systems which have led to a wide range of acyclic quadridentate neutral metal complexes. Activated benzimidazoles overall illustrate one electron irreversible oxidation to form a radical cation followed by multielectron oxidations. On the other hand, the nickelII and cobaltII benzimidazole metal complexes investigated showed one electron ligand centered reversible reduction. Irreversible radical cation oxidation followed by multielectron oxidation of the metal complexes further demonstrates the rich electrochemical nature of the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles. Some novel 7-(indol-2-yl)-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles were prepared with indolin-2-one and triflic anhydride and an alternate procedure afforded 2-(4,6-dimethoxyindol-7-yl)-benzimidazoles from activated indoles and 2-benzimidazolinone. Two new isomeric series of 2-substituted-5,7-dimethoxybenzothiazoles and 2-substituted-4,6-dimethoxybenzothiazoles were synthesized via Jacobson cyclization. The two strategically placed electron donating methoxy groups activate these benzothiazoles to undergo various electrophilic substitutions at the 4- and 7- positions respectively.
Synthetic strategies for the development of functionalised calixarenes for the study of their host-guest chemistry",2006,"Maharaj, Felicia Dolores Jacinta"
Studies in multicyclic chemistry,2006,"Al Djaidi, Djamal Sholeh"
"* A series of investigations has been carried out on multicyclic organic systems. The Ritter Reaction was used to obtain bridged imines containing an azacyclohexene functionality. The crystal structure of the benzene inclusion compound of one of these was determined, and also that of another spontaneously oxidised example. The reactivity of these bridged imines was then investigated using mercaptoacetic acid, and also dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD). The three bridged imines studied were found to react with DMAD in totally different ways and produced most unusual products whose structures were proved using X-ray crystallography. Mechanistic explanations are provided for the formation of these novel and totally unexpected products. * 6-Methylidene-3,3,7,7-tetramethylbicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one was reacted with acetonitrile and sulfuric acid to deliberately combine molecular rearrangement with Ritter Reaction chemistry. Five different products were obtained and the pathway of formation of these products was uncovered. The structures of three of these rearranged substances were confirmed by X-ray methods. * The rare tricyclo[5.3.1.1 3,9]dodecane ring system is known to contain severe skeletal distortions due to the nature of its skeleton. These properties were investigated by means of X-ray determinations at two temperatures. It was found that although the bond lengths were little affected, several of the bond angles were highly anomalous. These had angles far from the ideal tetrahedral value and, in some cases, were close to planar (120 degrees). The molecular motion of the skeleton was also investigated using variable temperature NMR measurements and energy values for the twisting motion involved were determined. * Schroeter and Vossen's Red Salt, first discovered in 1910, was investigated in detail by NMR and X-ray spectroscopy. The detailed structure of this most unusual compound was determined for the first time. * The Red Salt is based on the bicyclo[3.3.0]octane ring system and can be converted into several synthetically useful derivatives, including a tetraester and the 3,7-diketone. The former was shown to exist completely in the enolised tautomeric form (like Meerwein's Ester), and the latter was used as a synthetic entry for making diquinoline substituted analogues of interest in host-guest chemistry.
Model studies of the cub-histidine-tyrosine centre in cytochrome c oxidase",2005,"Lee, Sang Tae"
"This thesis reports the synthesis and copper coordination chemistry of covalently-linked aryl-imidazole derivatives designed as models for the crosslinked imidazole-phenol sidechains of the His-Tyr cofactor in the CcO. Three new imidazole- (HL1 - HL3) and three new indole- (HL4 - H2L6) containing tripodal ligands were synthesised. The conjugate addition of an imidazole to activated quinone derivatives was developed as a new route to organic models for the Tyr His cofactor. Two monodentate imidazole-aryl, Im-hq(OH)2 and Im-ArOH, and an imidazole-quinone, Im bq were obtained using this route. The X-ray crystal structure of Im-hq(OH)2.EtOH was determined. The route was also used to give new chelating ligands, H2L10 and HL12, containing a cross-linked imidazole-phenol surrogate for the Tyr244-His240 cofactor. Copper complexes of Im-hq(OH)2, Im-bq, Im-ArOH, H2L10-HL12, and HL1-H2L6 were prepared, and the X-ray crystal structures of [Cu(terpy)(Im-bq)][BF4]2 and five other copper complexes were determined. The physiochemical properties of the copper complexes were characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis-NIR, EPR and (spectro)electrochemical studies. Key results include: the oxidation of Im-ArO- anion affords the semiquinone radical, Im-sq(4OH)(1Oï¿½), in a hydrous solvent. However, the oxidations of neutral Im-ArOH and [Cu(tpa)(Im-ArOH)]2+ produce the corresponding phenoxy radical species that rapidly and reversibly dimerise to give quinol cyclohexadienone, QCHD, dimers. Significantly [Cu(tpa)(Im-sq(4OH)(1Oï¿½))]2+ was EPR silent, perhaps due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) (S=1/2) and semiquinonyl radical (S=1/2) centres. Deprotonation of the hydroquinone in [Cu(tpa)(Im-hq(OH)2]2+ produces the hydroquinone dianion which reduces the Cu(II) centre. The semiquinone radical is coordinatively labile and dissociates from the Cu(I) centre. The biological implications of these results are mentioned.
Enhancing the cooperative binding properties of1,1'-bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines)",2005,"Jones, Michael William"
"The design of partially reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline derivatives was investigated with the aim of controlling the conformation about the C1-C1' axis. This would produce ligands with unusual but predictable ligand binding properties, particularly cooperativity. The introduction of ω-aminoalkyl, ω-azidoalkyl, ω-alkynyl and ω-alkenyl groups onto the nitrogens of the reduced bisisoquinoline core was conducted with the intention of broadening the scope of the ligand. Subsequent epoxidation, hydroboration and Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal unsaturated groups and nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine of the corresponding known bischloroacetyl derivative afforded representative examples of new ligand types for future study. 1,1'-Bis(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline) was found to readily condense with a wide range of aldehydes to give imidazolines and aspects of the rates of condensation were determined. Mono-alkyl bisisoquinolines were obtained efficiently by cleavage of the imidazolines through a newly defined treatment with sodium cyanoborohydride under acidic conditions. A procedure was developed whereby these two steps could be accomplished in a sequential one-pot process. The mono-alkyl compounds were further derivatized through acetylation, alkylation, sulfonylation and reductive alkylation. Synthetic strategies towards π-excessive N-arenealkyl derivatives were established with the goal to create scaffolds for the coordination of π-deficient systems, of which the X-ray crystal structures of three N-arenemethyl derivatives were elucidated. These are each closely related in conformation about the C1-C1' axis. Reaction of two examples of the N-arenealkyl compounds with copper(II) and palladium(II) chlorides, furnished the first known examples of this type of highly reduced 1,1'-bisisoquinoline-metal complex. Single crystal X-ray crystallography was used to analyse the structures of these complexes in the solid state. Preliminary physicochemical investigations were conducted with a view to determining the conformation of the molecules about the bisisoquinoline C1-C1' bond. The interaction of intermolecular N-aryl π-excessive compounds with π-deficient systems was found to result in minimal spectroscopic changes. Complementary intramolecular π-excessive/π-deficient systems were found through fluorometric analysis to readily form charge transfer complexes. Finally, it was determined that the conformation of 1,1'-bis[2-(methoxy-18- crown-6)ethanoyl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline] could be controlled by the simultaneous coordination of the termini of the diperchlorate salt of 1,3-diaminopropane to the crown ether moieties of the ligand. A range of new N-substituted bisisoquinolines have been synthesised and methods developed for determining interactions between parts of these molecules that through these physicochemical characteristics could allow monitoring of conformational behaviour in future studies. Keywords: 1,1'-bisisoquinoline, conformational analysis, supramolecular chemistry, functional ligands, metal complexes.
Development of synthetic approaches towards molecules with potential SERM activity",2005,"Da Silva, Paulo Alexandre Reis"
"The primary aim of this project was to develop organometallic methodologies for the conversion of aryl benzyl ketones into aryl- and/or aroyl- substituted stilbenes related to Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs): Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, respectively. Consideration was given to target molecules that were acyclic, cyclic or heterocyclic. A secondary aim of the project was to develop methodologies that would allow combinatorial methods to be applied to the synthesis of these compounds, allowing quick access to a diverse range of SERM-candidate libraries of compounds. Primary methodologies that were examined included: Grignard, organocerium, and palladium-catalysed Negishi, Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. In addition, the rearrangement reaction of epoxides and nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides were explored as secondary means of new C-C bond construction. It was found the Grignard chemistry demanded the application of heat and suffered greatly from competing deprotonation reactions of the ketones due to the basicity of the organomagnesium reagents. The corresponding, less basic, organocerium reagents also gave low yields (0-11%). While these methodologies demonstrated some advantages, such as the direct addition of the nucleophilic components to the carbonyl groups of model ketones, they demonstrated some limitations, which were poor yields and restriction to using only carbonyl containing starting materials. Palladium-catalysed Negishi cross-coupling methodology was reliable in C-C bond formation but gave only moderate yields of isolated products. Stille reagents gave crosscoupled products readily and in high yields with sterically unhindered reactants, such as the enol triflate of â- tetralone. However, they did not readily cross-couple with the corresponding á-enol triflate and á-vinyl bromide reactants. This became an insurmountable barrier to their widespread use in SERM synthesis but did provide a sequence with selectivity. The Suzuki methodology was discovered to be superior to other methods of cross-coupling and the most reliable in furnishing both á- and â-coupled products in high yields. The yield of the palladium-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction at the á-position was found to follow the following order of reactivity: I &gt Br &gt OTf, in keeping with literature precedent, while the stability of the palladium-catalyst, and the choices of base and solvent affected the outcome of the reaction. The Suzuki reaction was also employed in a three-component carbonylative reaction to furnish unsymmetrical ketones, in model reactions towards Raloxifene-like structures, but the products were obtained in low to moderate yields. Initial investigations into the synthesis of closer model compounds through two-fold Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were limited by access to suitable precursors and this indicated a direction for future research.
Synthesis and reactivity of some new activated indoles",2004,"Wahyuningsih, Tutik Dwi"
Design and synthesis of new ligands and heterocycles from activated indoles,2004,"Pchalek, Karin"
"For the purpose of incorporating indoles into organometallic complexes for catalysis, as well as in the generation of new heterocyclic systems, various reactions have been carried out at C2, C6 and C7 of the indole system. In order to achieve this, 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindoles and 6-hydroxy- 4-methoxyindoles were necessary as starting materials. Consequently, a lithium-bromide-templated one-pot procedure for the synthesis of some 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindoles and a selective demethylation procedure for 3-substituted 6-hydroxy-4-methoxyindoles were developed. Various kinds of novel methylene-bridged bi-, tri-, and tetradentate pyridyl-indole ligands were synthesised via Vilsmeier-Haack, Friedel-Crafts or electrophilic addition reactions on the indole heterocycle. However, their metal complexing properties were generally weak and variable. Nevertheless, some of the tridentate pyridylindole ligands showed strong anion binding to halides, whereas a remarkable ligand transformation occurred with a bidentate 2-pyridylindole ligand and zinc(II), giving a substituted indolo[2,3-c]pyrrolo-[3,2,1-ij]quinoline system. Two new types of tetradentate Schiff base ligands were prepared from 2-formyl-indoles and 7-formyl-6-hydroxyindoles, and diamines. These preformed ligands were reacted with first- and second-row transition metals to give neutral metal complexes. Novel heterocyclic systems such as 4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines, 3H-pyrrolo-[1,2-a]indoles, and 1H-furo[2,3-g]indoles were synthesised from 2-formyl-, 7-formyl-, and 6-hydroxyindoles, utilising mainly intra-molecular Wittig reactions, Claisen-Schmidt condensations or acid- and base-catalysed cyclisations. A common feature of the prepared 4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolines and 3H-pyrrolo-[1,2-a]indoles was their intense fluorescent character, which was examined as well.
